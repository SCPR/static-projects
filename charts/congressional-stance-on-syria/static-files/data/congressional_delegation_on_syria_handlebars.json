Americans are outraged by President Assad's willful disregard for human rights through the use of chemical weapons. This action no longer justifies a strictly \"hands off\" diplomacy to what Americans once perceived as a regional conflict. Today I join my fellow lawmakers in condemning the Assad regime.
