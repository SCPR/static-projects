Rep.,Xavier Becerra,Xavier,Becerra,D,Los Angeles,"UPDATED STATEMENT: “In announcing today that he would seek Congressional approval for a targeted, strategic military strike on the Syrian government, President Obama is doing what's right for America and for the people who believe in what our nation stands for.  Americans deserve and expect open and transparent governance, particularly when decisions of life and death are at stake.  Congress will now have a chance to debate the President's call to action, and the evidence and rationale behind it.  Let us now be up to the task as we prepare for that vote.”

ORIGINAL STATEMENT: “The use of chemical weapons is immoral and an unmistakably heinous crime under international law.  
A perpetrator of such a barbarous act must be held accountable, otherwise the civilized world gives license to such crimes against humanity.  
 
What America does in response to the mass killings in Syria depends, for me, on the answer to two questions:
 
First, do we have compelling, uncontroverted evidence that chemical weapons were used and who was responsible?
 
Second, absent formal Congressional approval or United Nations authorization, is the proposed response targeted and strategic, aimed at deterring future outlaw behavior?
 
If the answer is yes to both questions, then I believe the President, after meaningful consultation with Congress, may act in defense of humanity and civilized nations.  Inaction in the face of strong evidence of mass killings from the unconscionable use of chemical weapons would be morally irresponsible.  But, what would be as wrong and indefensible as inaction would be a response, under these circumstances, that goes beyond legitimately seeking to deter the criminal behavior.  
 
Like all Americans, I am looking for answers, and in particular, for answers to the two crucial questions that I believe determine what America can and should do.  President Obama has a tough job and some tough decisions ahead of him. I believe the President, working with our nation's leaders and best advisers, will do what's right for America and for the people who believe in what America stands for.”",Congressman Xavier Becerra - (D-LA),http://a.scpr.org/i/79c79633804a925228f00fd1aa7136e2/54596-wide.jpg,Press releases,

Rep.,Zoe Lofgren,Zoe,Lofgren,D,San Jose,"""When President Obama tells us that he has not yet made a ""decision"" on whether the U.S. military will commence hostilities with Syria, he has misunderstood his authority. As Constitutional scholars have said, including Mr. Obama himself when he was running for his office, the President should understand that it is not his decision alone to make. He is required to obtain the consent of the U.S. Congress before he engages in hostilities with Syria. To commence hostilities without statutory authorization from Congress violates the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the United States Constitution. To argue that dropping bombs on another country for a short period of time is not an act of war is foolishness.

Internationally his footing is equally perilous. Without a resolution from the UN Security Council, and in the face of a request from the UN that no action commence until a full report from UN inspectors is received, America cannot commence hostilities with Syria while remaining within the bounds of international law.

The Obama administration says we must act to defend ""international norms."" But how can we defend international norms by breaking international law?

For the President to act without Congressional authorization, without UN approval, without the support of the Arab League, and without our closest ally Great Britain, would be a serious error. The debate on the wisdom of military action, and what form it might take should we choose that option, remains to be had in the Congress of the United States, and in the context of the wishes of the American people. President Obama must not rush to action without allowing our American democracy and Constitutional system to function.

Like many Members of Congress, I doubt the wisdom of initiating further hostilities in the Middle East. However, like all Members, I will approach that debate with an open mind, listen to the President, and then join with my colleagues in exercising our Constitutional and statutory authority over matters of war and peace. Only after such a debate, and only with the approval of both houses of Congress, could the President legitimately proceed.""",Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren - (D-San Jose),http://a.scpr.org/i/7f5dc9362f2f29325ce012439d36fef8/54597-wide.jpg,,http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=827&Itemid=130

Now that the President has called for a vote on a new authorization to use force, it is all the more essential that we be called back into session immediately.

""This is not a judgment to be made by the Congress in haste, and consultation with the Administration needs to intensify now. I was briefed by the intelligence community again yesterday, and look forward to tomorrow's hearing and to discussing this issue with my colleagues.""

ORIGINAL STATEMENT: ""If we don't act on this red line now I think we'll be sending a message not only to the Assad regime that they can continue the use of chemical weapons, but to others around the world who may contemplate this.""",Congressman Adam Schiff - (D-Glendale),http://a.scpr.org/i/5fe587ea8a39086d95d134d5425a1aa4/54546-wide.jpg,"Updated: Press release; Original: CNN

Rep.,Brad Sherman,Brad,Sherman,D,Sherman Oaks,"""Under the War Powers Act the President may not put American forces into hostilities for more than 60 days without Congressional approval.

""The Syrian opposition includes al-Qaeda affiliated elements. However the Assad regime poses a greater threat to U.S. national security interests as is illustrated by Assad's alliance with Iran and Hezbollah. We should demonstrate to Assad, and dictators who come after him, that they will pay a significant military price if they use chemical weapons — particularly if they use chemical weapons on a large scale against civilians.""",Congressman Brad Sherman - (D-Sherman Oaks),http://a.scpr.org/i/d7eef28b6b29158970229989cc158bb7/54552-wide.jpg,,

Rep.,Henry Waxman,Henry,Waxman,D,Los Angeles,"I don't see the purpose of a strike against Syria for using chemical weapons. It would only show our unhappiness for their use of chemical weapons on their own people. I think not much can be accomplished by such a strike. I do think the President should ask congress for approval for any action on Syria of a military nature. I don't see what can be accomplished. I think we ought to ask what happens next after we attack Syria. If they use chemical weapons again, do we attack them again? Why are we doing this on our own and not with the rest of the international community?",Congressman Henry Waxman - (D-Los Angeles),http://a.scpr.org/i/1600cfbf17bf5e3f0566dffbadffdb89/54567-wide.jpg,Interview with KPCC,
