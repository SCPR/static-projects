###Tracking rainfall during the 2016-2017 water year

There are two elements contained in this repo. The first is a chart ([live here](http://projects.scpr.org/charts/rainfall-2017/)) that shows how weighted precipitation totals this year, along with the median precipitation and median precipitation of just the past five strong La Ni√±a 'water years'. This data comes via [David Pierce of Scripps](http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/sdprecip/). The raw data is updated daily [at this link](http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/kpbs/). KPCC uses the file make_indices_v6.LA_basin.365.out.cumul.txt.

The second element is a 'gauge' that shows the most recent precipitation percent. This is only the single most recent data point from the chart. The code for the gauge [was based on this neat open-source liquid fill gauge](http://bl.ocks.org/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6).

I plan these updated throughout the winter storm season, and the full water year as storms come through the region. Questions, comments, criticism to amendelson AT scpr DOT org
