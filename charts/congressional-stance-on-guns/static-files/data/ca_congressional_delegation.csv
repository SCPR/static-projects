More specifically, I have proposed measures to strengthen the ATF’s ability to conduct checks on the records of licensed gun dealers.  Additionally, it is time that we treat all firearms the same. Whether it is a rifle, shotgun or handgun, our laws should universally apply.  The same laws and background check requirements that are in place for handguns should be extended to cover long guns.”",F000030
