                <p>The U.S. Senate is currently wading through a massive, comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes a path to citizenship, among other proposals. The bill was developed by a working group of eight senators from both sides of the aisle. A similar group in the House of Representatives is still developing its version of immigration reform. KPCC surveyed the entire California delegation to assess where members stand on key elements that are expected to be considered in both versions of the bill.</p>
