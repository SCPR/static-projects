                <p>The federal government is shut down. What about the office of your member of Congress?</p>
                <p>It's up to each lawmaker, with guidance from either the Senate counsel or the House Administration Committee. Democrat  Barbara Boxer says Senators were advised to "keep people on make it possible for you to fulfill your legislative function and also you can have some communications people so people know what youâ€™re doing." But not the folks who handle constituent complaints.</p>
                <p>Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks got different advice: "We should
                designate all our people essential, if indeed they were critical to doing what is required of the member of Congress and their office."</p>
                <p>But that's just guidance. See below for information about Southern California lawmakers.</p>
