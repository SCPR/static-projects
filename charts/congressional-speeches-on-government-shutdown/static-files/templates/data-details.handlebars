            <p>Wonder where members of the California Congressional delegation stand on the federal government shutdown, or what they've said about Obamacare or the debt ceiling? And how about what they've said before the shutdown went into effect on Oct. 1?</p>
            <p>We can't bring you all of their public statements, but thanks to <a href="http://capitolwords.org/about/" target="blank">CapitolWords</a>, a <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/" target="blank">Sunlight Foundation</a> project that culls speeches from the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CREC" target="blank">Congressional Record</a> and makes them searchable by topic, state and legislator, we're able to shed some light on the state delegation's thoughts leading up to and since the federal government closed its doors.</p>
