            <p>As the economy has picked up since 2009, more trucks have been on the roads. That's meant more big truck collisions, which have an outsized cost, both financially and in terms of human life. Not only have their numbers jumped, but the share of all collisions that involve a big truck has been on the rise. That's what these charts show.</p>

            <p>Below are the trends in 55 of California's 58 counties — each county with a population of at least 10,000. While you can see broad similarities between many counties, each graph tells its own story.</p>

            <p>The highest share of truck collisions was in 2008 in sparsely-populated Siskiyou county. That year, 90 truck-involved collisions accounted for fully 16.54 percent of the 544 reported crashes. The lowest share came in even-more-sparsely-populated Mariposa County. In 2012, only two crashes involved big trucks, just 0.88 percent of collisions.</p>
