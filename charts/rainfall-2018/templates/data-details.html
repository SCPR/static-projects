            <p>How much rain has Southern California <em>really</em> received this year? Did that last storm make a difference in the water picture? Will a forecasted weak La Niña come to pass? To answer these questions, KPCC is working with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography to put our precipitation in context.</p>
            <p>The graph below reflects rainfall data from 20 rain gauges around the Los Angeles Basin. These gauges have detailed records stretching back decades, and give a picture of how much rain is falling across the region. This year's rainfall is reflected in the the blue line.</p>
            <p>The dark gray line shows the median, or typical year. The light gray line displays the median for five previous strong La Niñas: 1974, 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2000. The graph shows the full year, although Southern California typically receives most of its precipitation during the first six months of the water year. A number above 100 means it's been an above-average year for rain.</p>
