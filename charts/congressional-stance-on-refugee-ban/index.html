                                                <p>I believe that the policy of placing a temporary hold on persons from countries that are known exporters of terrorism while we reevaluate and strengthen our vetting procedures makes sense. Contrary to some partisan claims, this is not a Muslim ban - none of the countries included are in the top 5 in total Muslim population and make up only 7 of 47 majority Muslim countries.

                                                <p>The Trump White House&#39;s actions to deny entry to all refugees and to travelers from certain Muslim countries, including people with visas and lawful permanent residents of the United States, are discriminatory and un-American. We will be fighting these unconstitutional actions in every venue, and I&#39;ll be joining many of my House and Senate colleagues to make our voices heard at the Supreme Court today. The judicial and legislative branches have a responsibility to defend and uphold the Constitution, especially when the White House does not. President Trump must withdraw this executive order, and those in Congress who are tacitly allowing this injustice to happen will be remembered for their complicity in this disgraceful episode.

                                                <p>Protecting our homeland from foreign terrorist entry has always been a priority of mine. We can do so without rejecting tired and weary families who have already undergone 18 months of intense vetting, praying for peace after fleeing war. Our energy and resources are precious. We should not waste them on policies that cause chaos and heartbreak while failing to make the U.S. safer. Friday&#39;s executive order violates America&#39;s fundamental values while failing to increase our national security. We must be on guard to protect our country from terrorist threats, both foreign and domestic, but we can do so without creating a climate of fear and uncertainty. The tired and weary families who have already undergone 18 months of intense vetting deserve better than this. The greencard holders, contributing members of our society who did everything they were supposed to, deserve better than this. The translators, guides, and others who risked their lives to help America when it mattered most deserve better than this. Over the past 40 years, not one refugee from the countries listed under this ban has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the U.S.

                                                <p>We already have a vetting system for refugees that&#39;s thorough, exhaustive, &amp; successful. It takes 2+ years &amp; numerous background checks. I don&#39;t want anyone entering this country who could pose a threat to Americans, but intelligence officials have said our process works. Those who apply for refugee status are children, women, &amp; people who risked their lives helping our troops fight the war on terror. They face death and torture if they aren&#39;t granted refugee status. This is personal for me. One of my interns was a refugee from Afghanistan. He put his life on the line to help our soldiers. I did everything I could to help him build a new life in America. He&#39;s hardworking, dedicated, &amp; we&#39;re better for having him in America. It&#39;s not right to turn our back on people. This isn&#39;t the American way.

                                                <p>A sweeping denial of refuge to families facing persecution and bloodshed abroad is not an effective way to protect our citizens. My first priority is always the safety of the American people, and to be clear, refugees already undergo more rigorous security screenings than any other traveler or immigrant to the U.S. President Trump&#39;s decision to target immigrants from Muslim-majority countries goes against the essential right to religious liberty that is a founding principle of our nation. We can, and we must, protect Americans while also recognizing the basic humanity of all people.

                                                <p>This executive order is a dramatic overreach that lacks understanding of and respect for our constitution, and goes against the core of what makes us Americans. As a member of Congress, it is my duty to speak out against actions that I believe are unAmerican, and I urge my colleagues -- both Democrats and Republicans -- to do the same. Law-abiding, documented residents of our country are facing chaos and instability. The uncertainty this has created among workers, students, and at our airports is wreaking havoc on families and businesses. The message this sends internationally does not reflect who we are as a nation of immigrants -- we do not close our doors to those who are fleeing persecution, or target people based on their faith. Since being elected, my office and I have helped constituents navigate a wide range of immigration issues, and we are here to continue to help. Contact us at bera.house.gov.

                                                <p>The injunction against President Trump&#39;s Executive Order must be immediately enforced nationwide to prevent further harm from his immoral and unconstitutional ban on Muslims. I support the efforts of the ACLU and others to challenge this order on Constitutional grounds, and call on the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to respect the district court&#39;s nationwide injunction prohibiting the U.S. government from removing lawful permanent residents and nonimmigrants who are returning home to the United States. Any delays in implementing the injunction will have extremely harmful ramifications across the United States as families, coworkers and communities will be arbitrarily separated.  I expect a full report from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs as to the wellbeing and status of those who have been affected by the Executive Order. As the Statue of Liberty holds her torch of welcome high, there are tears in her eyes as she sees how low this Administration has stooped in its callousness toward immigrant families and refugees who have trusted in the laws and protections of the United States. House Democrats will continue to defend our Constitution and demand smart and strong action to defeat terrorists while protecting religious freedoms.

                                                <p>I am outraged by President Trump&#39;s executive order banning immigrants and refugees from the United States on the basis of religion. This pronouncement violates constitutional principles and disregards religious tolerance - a cornerstone of American democracy. Let me be clear: by turning his back on individuals and families fleeing Muslim-majority countries, President Trump is effectively implementing his campaign promise of closing  our doors to Muslim refugees. This is a watershed moment for our country, a moment that brings into question our moral character. People of conscience must unite in opposition to this un-American policy which weakens our leadership on the world stage and poses a direct threat to our national security. Now is the time for the resistance to stand up and show President Trump that the United States must remain a beacon of hope for those in need no matter who they are or how they worship. We are better than this.

                                                <p>America is built on immigrants - I am the daughter of one myself. President Trump&#39;s actions barring refugees, splitting up families, and destroying lives is truly reprehensible. I am ashamed at what he has done to our country and to all those individuals and families that have been impacted by this hateful policy, including an estimated half a million people who live here legally with green cards and contribute to our nation&#39;s economic and social success. Let me be clear, we already do exhaustive vetting that takes approximately 18 months. Many of those detained yesterday were actually American patriots serving the military as translators and aides. The President relishes chaos. We must demand rationality and constitutional respect in the process.

                                                <p>Time and time again President Trump has mocked, ridiculed, and threatened anyone who is different from him in our country. Today, he took steps to temporarily shut our doors to those seeking refuge in the United States. Our refugee resettlement program already contains the most stringent screening in the world including thirteen steps of tough vetting. The refugees that the President has shut our doors to today are not terrorists, they are the victims of terrorism who have occupied their homelands. As a child of immigrants, I will continue to stand up for refugees and vigorously oppose the Administration&#39;s shameful efforts to rob hope from the hopeless.

                                                <p>I will undertake a legal analysis of President Trump̍s executive order today, and will issue a comprehensive review soon. However, it seems clear that the effects of today&#39;s orders will be discriminatory and isolationist. They are un-American, driven by xenophobia, and will damage our nation&#39;s standing around the world. If accurately reported, Trump&#39;s actions appear to lay the foundation for a total ban on Muslims from entry to the United States - an unprecedented and deeply worrisome development. He further proposes to slash the overall refugee program dramatically and intends to place additional burdens to those who might remain eligible for safe haven. Perhaps most troubling, today&#39;s executive order - issued on Holocaust Remembrance Day, no less - recalls a dark episode in American history. Just over 75 years ago, a ship called the St. Louis, carrying nearly a thousand Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, sailed so close to the United States that passengers could see the lights of Miami. But rather than welcome these refugees, America turned them away. Many of these Jewish refugees were killed by the Nazi&#39;s when they were forced to return to Europe. Making sure that such a tragedy never happens again became the bedrock of U.S. and international refugee and asylum law and policy. Mr. Trump&#39;s actions today upend this foundational principle and endanger millions all over the world.

                                                <p>People around the world look to the United States as a beacon of hope and freedom through its enlightened and bold leadership. This past week, disappointedly and disturbingly, our executive branch did a disservice to our nation&#39;s fundamental values by making disgraceful decisions based on intolerance, racism, and fear. That type of insular reaction is contrary to the historical responsibilities of our nation to welcome those fleeing terror and persecution. When my grandparents came to this country to attain the American Dream, they were welcomed by the Statue of Liberty. The text at the base of that beacon reads, &#39;Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.&#39; We must never forget that being American means that we bear the burden to serve one another and welcome people of all religions and nationalities who are willing to come here and share in that responsibility. President Trump&#39;s executive actions are not reflective of our values. As a nation of immigrants, we are stronger because of our diversity, and when we come together in the name of inclusivity and equality, our voices cannot be silenced.

                                                <p>Based on my studies of this issue during numerous trips abroad related to intelligence matters, I&#39;ve stated repeatedly that refugee flows from certain war-torn regions pose a serious national security threat to the United States. In light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe&#39;s tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration&#39;s executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland. While accommodations should be made for green card holders and those who&#39;ve assisted the U.S. armed forces, this is a useful temporary measure on seven nations of concern until we can verify who is entering the United States.

                                                <p>By challenging the unjust incarceration of over 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II, Fred Korematsu served as a beacon of hope during an otherwise shameful time in our nation&#39;s history. His courageous actions cemented his legacy as a civil rights icon, and his story reminds us that we must always be vigilant in protecting the civil rights of all Americans. This is especially true now more than ever with President Trump&#39;s abhorrent executive order targeting immigrants, refugees, and Muslims. These shameful actions are fueled by the same hysteria and prejudice that led to Japanese American internment during WWII, but we must not allow history to repeat itself. As President Trump implements his Muslim ban and targets immigrants and other minority communities, Korematsu Day is also a reminder of the importance of President Trump&#39;s Supreme Court nominee this week. I urge my Senate colleagues from both parties to resist nominees that will provide legal justification for oppression. Instead, we must recommit ourselves to opposing discrimination and speaking out against intolerance and injustice whenever it occurs.

                                                <p>We are a nation founded on religious liberty whose doors have always been open to those fleeing persecution and seeking a better life. Donald Trump&#39;s executive order today establishes a religious test for those coming from certain Muslim countries.  It would turn away women and children fleeing violence unless they worship in the right way or to the right God. It would represent a dangerous first step in the institutionalization of prejudice against practitioners of a certain faith. That this order was issued on Holocaust Remembrance Day demonstrates what a poor student of history the President is, and how much it will fall upon Congress to ensure that America does not allow any repetition of the mistakes and tragedies of the past.

                                                <p>On Friday, President Trump issued an executive order that targets refugees and immigrants based on their religion. His xenophobic rhetoric and actions are not consistent with the values of our nation. This executive order will do nothing to make our country safer and only sends a message of hate and bigotry to the rest of the world. This order would not have prevented the attack in San Bernardino and the use of San Bernardino as justification for this anti-Muslim policy is a revolting way to exploit our community. Federal judges around the country have issued orders to halt detentions and deportations. Despite these orders, the Department of Homeland Security, under the president&#39;s direction, is continuing to enforce the executive order and proceeding with detentions, removals and denial of access to attorneys. This is abhorrent. This is inhumane. This is unconstitutional. President Trump&#39;s actions are in violation of the United States Constitution and he must be held accountable immediately.

                                                <p>Today&#39;s executive order by President Trump using extreme vetting and banning refugees from many majority Muslim countries is offensive and a monumental waste of federal resources.  Having served on active duty, we are taught that to defeat the enemy, we first need to know our enemy.  Our enemies are terrorist groups such as ISIS and AL Qaeda, not children, women and senior citizens fleeing those groups. The chances of being struck by lightning TWICE is 1 in 9 million.  The chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion.  These facts lead me to conclude that Trump&#39;s action is not based on national security, it is based on bigotry. Lady Liberty is crying.

                                                <p>Donald Trump&#39;s Executive Order on refugees is more reckless fear-mongering that has no basis in reality.  Refugees already undergo a long, rigorous screening process that often takes years.  While we should work to continuously monitor and improve that process, there is no reason to bring it to a crashing halt or to enact a blanket ban on those coming from certain Muslim-majority countries. Having spoken to many refugee families in my district, I know that they are no different from me and my family.  We all are looking to provide a future for our loved ones and contribute to this great country.  Closing America&#39;s doors to those fleeing unimaginable hardships is an affront to our values as a nation, and targeting people based on their faith is downright un-American.  Throughout our history, our nation has been a beacon of hope and freedom.  Today&#39;s actions go against those very ideals and will ultimately erode the moral leadership of the United States across the globe.

                                                <p>President Trump&#39;s executive order does not make us safer and abandons this nation&#39;s commitment to refugees.  The order&#39;s masking of religious discrimination against refugees, legal permanent residents, and visa holders in the name of national security is reprehensible and illegal. It puts in place policies with astounding and inexcusable religious discrimination at levels not seen since World War II. While I am pleased that federal courts have temporarily blocked removals, the courts and Congress must act quickly to prevent the long-term damage to our country that this administration&#39;s policies will bring about, and to demonstrate to our Muslim brothers and sisters that we will not tolerate discrimination against them. I will do everything in my power to ensure that all those who have already been properly vetted will have legal access to the United States, and I will continue to speak out against all unconstitutional policies of President Trump.

                                                <p>President Trump&#39;s executive order turns America&#39;s back to the suffering of thousands of men, women, and children fleeing unspeakable violence. The ongoing humanitarian tragedy in Syria requires us to rise to the occasion and demonstrate our commitment to standing up for victims of oppression around the world. Instead, we are sending a messaging to desperate families that they are on their own. This is a shameful moral failure that will feed into anti-American rhetoric and damage our security at home and our interests abroad. The truth is the United States already thoroughly vets all refugees and all foreign citizens requesting a visa. President Trump will soon realize that the policy of &quot;extreme vetting&quot; he advanced during the campaign has been U.S. policy for several years. As the descendent of parents and grandparents imprisoned in Japanese American internment camps, I am sickened by the use of collective punishment against all citizens of a certain nationality. This executive order is plainly un-American and plays to our worst instincts of tribalism and nationalism. On its own, this executive order marks a terrible moment for our country and a stain on our legacy. But for President Trump to sign this order on International Holocaust Remembrance Day is an insult to the memories of the Jewish refugees who were murdered when too few nations stepped up to shelter them.

                                                <p>I am deeply appalled but not in the least bit shocked by President Trump&#39;s actions over the last week that reflect just how ill-prepared he is to govern our country. President Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.8 million votes and was elected with the assistance of the Russian government, has managed in a single week to offend a key ally, raise premiums on homeowners, and implement an un-American immigration ban, all while advancing new lies and conspiracy theories with each passing day. The Administration&#39;s ban on immigrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries is not the result of thoughtful policymaking, but yet another action catering to the President&#39;s small base of support. The order prohibits entry into the U.S. to immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - for the next 90 days and suspends the admission of refugees for the next 120 days. This shortsighted executive order fails to make any distinction between people who deserve to come to the United States and those who do not. The order has already resulted in the detention of an Iraqi man who courageously worked with the U.S. government for 10 years after the U.S. invaded Iraq. The order even prohibits re-entry to permanent U.S. residents from these countries, who will now be forced to apply for waivers just to return to their homes and families in the United States. The Administration&#39;s ban on refugees is especially deplorable. It targets women, men, and children who are fleeing brutal repression in countries like Syria and who were hoping to find freedom in the United States of America. Contrary to what the Administration would have the American public believe, the Administration&#39;s immigration ban is not even an effective way to combat or prevent domestic terror attacks. Of the most tragic terrorist attacks that have occurred on American soil over the past few years, including the Boston marathon bombing, the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, and the San Bernardino shooting, none of the perpetrators were born in any of the seven affected countries. The order does not even cover Saudi Arabia, the country that was the origin of 15 of the 19 terrorists who carried out the horrendous September 11th terrorist attacks. The President&#39;s executive order was clearly motivated by prejudice against Muslims and a desire to appeal to a small group of people who share his prejudiced views. However, instead of making our nation a safer place for all Americans, the order will make us less safe by providing ISIS and other terrorist groups propaganda that they can use to recruit new fighters and encourage attacks. Not only is the Administration&#39;s immigration ban immoral and likely unconstitutional, it goes against everything for which the United States stands, as a nation of immigrants and a beacon of hope for people around the world. President Trump must understand that governing a nation is serious business and his actions have consequences both in the United States and abroad. The American people are not pawns in a reality show, and he cannot simply sit in the White House and sign decrees as if he were a king unbound by any check on his power and authority. Those in Congress who remain silent and fail to condemn this executive order will share in the responsibility for the resulting injustices.

                                                <p>I condemn in the strongest terms the President&#39;s executive order banning refugees and the citizens of Muslim nations. This ban, whether temporary or not, is shameful, wholly un-American at its core, and as written, unconstitutional. The history of our nation is one written by the refugee and the immigrant; people across the globe who fled religious persecution, war, famine, and poverty. People seeking a better life - one based not in fear, but in freedom and liberty. They chose America, which has long endured as the shining beacon on the hill. Sadly, that light was dimmed this weekend by the President&#39;s immigration executive order. This ban also makes Americans both here and abroad less safe by perpetuating the false narrative that America hates Islam as a religion. It is the duty of the government to protect our nation and our people, but there are ways to do this that are effective, rational, humane, and constitutional. We, as a nation, have done it before. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of my constituents fled the horrors of war and genocide in Vietnam and Cambodia as refugees. Today, these immigrants and their children are doctors, teachers, parents, student&#39;all integral parts of our nation. They are here because American presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan stood up and did the right thing. Today, we must stand and fight for those same American values that welcome refugees to our country and recognize that our nation is great because it is built by refugees and immigrants from every part of the world. Martin Niemiller warned us in his famous quote &quot;First they came for&quot; about the dangers of remaining silent when others are persecuted. I refuse to be silent. I will not shy away from what I see as a fight for the basic fundamentals of what this country stands for: freedom, equality, and moral compassion. I will do everything in my power to fight against this unconstitutional, un-American ban on refuges and citizens of Muslim nations.

                                                <p>America is a nation of immigrants. Our country has been built by the hard work of those who&#39;ve come here for liberty and to find hope in a land of opportunity. A welcoming America is not incompatible with a strong and secure America.  We can put in place a vetting process that the American people have confidence in. To do so, the Congress must work with the administration to swiftly reestablish strong and clear screening procedures so that our rich tradition of immigration is not permanently threatened by those who wish us harm.

                                                <p>President Trump&#39;s order to shut the door on families fleeing violence and oppression betrays our values as Americans. So-called &quot;extreme-vetting&quot; has always been cover for policies based in fear and discrimination, particularly towards Muslims. Our rigorous vetting processes, which often take years to complete even for women and children, are the reason we don&#39;t have to choose between security and being a haven for those seeking freedom and prosperity in America. Refusing to accept refugees from Syria and blocking entry to interpreters who helped us in Iraq gives terrorist groups like ISIS exactly what they want, and will set us back in our efforts to bring peace and stability to the region. Barring legal travel from Muslim nations does nothing to make us safer and is unbelievably cruel to the students, scientists, and families who are building lives here and contributing to the fabric of our nation. This provision, as well as the suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, open us up to retaliation from other countries that will divide families and wreak havoc on businesses and universities. Immigrants and refugees have made America into what it is today, and closing our doors to them diminishes our role as a global force for peace and robs us of talented individuals that make our nation stronger and more prosperous. I have to believe that many of my Republican colleagues know how wrong this is and how it will hurt our national security and our economy. I call on them to do the right thing - the courageous thing - and work with us to unwind this disastrous order.

                                                <p>Federal courts have rightly stayed President Trump&#39;s unconstitutional executive order banning Muslims and refugees. Immigration officials need to follow and respect the rule of the federal judges and allow those being held to have access to attorneys. The right of habeas corpus is a bedrock of our democracy. Congress needs to take immediate action to repeal Trump&#39;s Executive Order. The Muslim ban is a policy based on fear not strength.  This order will do nothing to keep us safe. If anything, it will likely have the opposite effect. This executive order will also reduce the stature and influence America will have globally. America has always been a beacon of hope and freedom around the world. This executive order slams the door on those seeking refuge from violence and oppression and runs contrary to the values that have defined America for generations. We already have one of the most stringent and thorough screening processes for vetting refugees, taking years to complete.

                                                <p>Under the president&#39;s executive order, Syrian refugees can only come to this country if they are Christian - regardless of the level of persecution or need. To me, this an unbelievable action. It&#39;s one thing to see that an individual is properly vetted. It&#39;s an entirely different matter to say that because someone comes from a particular country or is a member of a particular faith that he or she has no access to this country. Let us recall the images of the body of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy, washed up on a beach and remember the staggering human toll of this crisis. There is no legitimate national security reason to ban refugee - the vast majority of whom are women and children who have experienced absolute horror. Also shocking is that relatives of American families from Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen can&#39;t even visit the United States. I very much regret that the president has chosen this dark path for our country.

                                                <p>Make no mistake - this is a Muslim ban. Broad brush discrimination against refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, most of whom are women and children, runs counter to our national security interests, and will likely be used as a terrorist recruitment tool. Opening our doors to those fleeing war and oppression has been the policy of presidents of both parties for decades. This moral leadership enhances our ability to shape world events, promotes global stability, and makes us stronger at home. Whether it&#39;s a small business owner in Sacramento employing fellow Californians or a student in Los Angeles completing cutting edge research, refugees are contributing to our country and our economy. They enrich our communities; they do not make us less safe.
