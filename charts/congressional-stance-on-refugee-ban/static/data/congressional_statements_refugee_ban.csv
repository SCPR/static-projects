President Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.8 million votes and was elected with the assistance of the Russian government, has managed in a single week to offend a key ally, raise premiums on homeowners, and implement an un-American immigration ban, all while advancing new lies and conspiracy theories with each passing day. The Administration's ban on immigrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries is not the result of thoughtful policymaking, but yet another action catering to the President's small base of support. The order prohibits entry into the U.S. to immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - for the next 90 days and suspends the admission of refugees for the next 120 days. This shortsighted executive order fails to make any distinction between people who deserve to come to the United States and those who do not. The order has already resulted in the detention of an Iraqi man who courageously worked with the U.S. government for 10 years after the U.S. invaded Iraq. The order even prohibits re-entry to permanent U.S. residents from these countries, who will now be forced to apply for waivers just to return to their homes and families in the United States. The Administration's ban on refugees is especially deplorable. It targets women, men, and children who are fleeing brutal repression in countries like Syria and who were hoping to find freedom in the United States of America. Contrary to what the Administration would have the American public believe, the Administration's immigration ban is not even an effective way to combat or prevent domestic terror attacks. Of the most tragic terrorist attacks that have occurred on American soil over the past few years, including the Boston marathon bombing, the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, and the San Bernardino shooting, none of the perpetrators were born in any of the seven affected countries. The order does not even cover Saudi Arabia, the country that was the origin of 15 of the 19 terrorists who carried out the horrendous September 11th terrorist attacks. The President's executive order was clearly motivated by prejudice against Muslims and a desire to appeal to a small group of people who share his prejudiced views. However, instead of making our nation a safer place for all Americans, the order will make us less safe by providing ISIS and other terrorist groups propaganda that they can use to recruit new fighters and encourage attacks. Not only is the Administration's immigration ban immoral and likely unconstitutional, it goes against everything for which the United States stands, as a nation of immigrants and a beacon of hope for people around the world. President Trump must understand that governing a nation is serious business and his actions have consequences both in the United States and abroad. The American people are not pawns in a reality show, and he cannot simply sit in the White House and sign decrees as if he were a king unbound by any check on his power and authority. Those in Congress who remain silent and fail to condemn this executive order will share in the responsibility for the resulting injustices.",NULL,Oppose,1/28/17,facebook,https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/posts/10154167889030009,Chris Keller/KPCC

This ban, whether temporary or not, is shameful, wholly un-American at its core, and as written, unconstitutional. The history of our nation is one written by the refugee and the immigrant; people across the globe who fled religious persecution, war, famine, and poverty. People seeking a better life - one based not in fear, but in freedom and liberty. They chose America, which has long endured as the shining beacon on the hill. Sadly, that light was dimmed this weekend by the President's immigration executive order. This ban also makes Americans both here and abroad less safe by perpetuating the false narrative that America hates Islam as a religion. It is the duty of the government to protect our nation and our people, but there are ways to do this that are effective, rational, humane, and constitutional. We, as a nation, have done it before. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of my constituents fled the horrors of war and genocide in Vietnam and Cambodia as refugees. Today, these immigrants and their children are doctors, teachers, parents, student'all integral parts of our nation. They are here because American presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan stood up and did the right thing. Today, we must stand and fight for those same American values that welcome refugees to our country and recognize that our nation is great because it is built by refugees and immigrants from every part of the world. Martin Niemiller warned us in his famous quote ""First they came for"" about the dangers of remaining silent when others are persecuted. I refuse to be silent. I will not shy away from what I see as a fight for the basic fundamentals of what this country stands for: freedom, equality, and moral compassion.

Barring legal travel from Muslim nations does nothing to make us safer and is unbelievably cruel to the students, scientists, and families who are building lives here and contributing to the fabric of our nation. This provision, as well as the suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, open us up to retaliation from other countries that will divide families and wreak havoc on businesses and universities.
