		<p class="character">Regina Zodiacal</p>

                <div class="prose">

   					<p>In the last, lingering days of summer 2012, Regina Zodiacal became the girl she swore she’d never be.

					<p>Zodiacal’s mother was in and out of prison. She never knew her father. But she wanted the things most of us want.

					<p>When she was 12, Zodiacal went to her neighborhood library in Santa Ana after school for help with her homework. She grew close to an aunt who took care of her during the long stretches while her mother was locked up, and a cousin who she came to see as a sister.
 <p>But Zodiacal never could make her life work. At 15, she left home.

					<p>“I grew up on the streets,” said Zodiacal, now 29 (needs CQ). “I’ve always been on my own and got money in the way I knew how, and that’s fast money.”

					<p>The convictions started piling up. She pled guilty to burglary and grand theft when she was 20. Most of the other charges were minor: drug possession, failure to appear, possession of metal knuckles.

					<p>One morning last August, Zodical she stepped into her local Kohls Department store (needs CQ) in Santa Ana.

					<p>Maybe it was her tattoos, but she caught the eye of an undercover security agent, Cynthia Hardman. She watched Zodiacal enter the fitting room with two garments – and kept her eyes on the door. Zodiacal emerged empty-handed and walked toward the exit. Hardman sent a male colleague, another loss prevention officer, to confront Zodiacal.

					<p>He caught up to her in the parking lot. According to court records, Zodiacal made threatening motions to him with what appeared to be a pocketknife, and then fled.

					<p>She was apprehended moments later. Inside her purse were two women’s “tops” from the store, tags still attached. Together, they were worth $66. According to the transcripts of a court hearing, it doesn’t appear the weapon was ever found (needs CQ).

					<p>Weeks later, Zodiacal was sitting in Santa Ana county jail, awaiting trial. That’s when she learned she was pregnant. She had become “that girl” - the one who would “go to prison to give birth.”


				<p class="character">Christina Bray</p>

	<p>A year earlier and 400 miles away in San Jose, Nick Bellane hobbled into the local JP Morgan Chase branch where he banked. He was 96 years old, mostly deaf and blind and had few local relatives.

	<p>The retired handyman had become fond of Christina Bray, the young bank manager who diligently took care of his bank accounts.

	<p>In the summer of 2011, Bray became an even more important part of his life. She began driving him to doctor’s appointments and visiting him at home. He affectionately called her “mother,” although she was only 30 years old.

	<p>He didn’t question her when she asked him to sign withdrawal slips or told him he should open a joint account with her husband, Jimmy, at Comercia Bank.

	<p>But Bellane’s niece thought it was odd a bank manager would visit a client at home. She called the District Attorney’s Office. An investigator was interviewing Bellane as the couple pulled up to visit on Dec. 22, 2011. They walked out in handcuffs.

	<p>The Brays stole over $1 million dollars from Bellane. They used it to buy fancy cars, jewelry and even pay for liposuction.

	<p>“He completely relied on her,” said Deputy Dist. Atty. Cherie Bourlard. When he found out she’d been stealing from him, she said he was devastated.

	<p>Bray was more than eight months pregnant when she was arrested.

	<p>As she waited to be booked into jail, she was thinking about how she would break this news to her three older daughters from her first marriage. Then the contractions began.

	<p>Slow at first, but distinctly paced and becoming more and more intense. Bray was going into labor.

                <div class="prose">

					<p class="character">Regina Zodiacal</p>

                    <p>A few weeks after finding out she was pregnant, Zodiacal took a plea deal. </p>

					<p>Authorities had connected her to some fraudulent checks. She was facing two strikes in California’s three-strike felony system. She accepted one strike - armed robbery - and a two-year prison sentence. It would be her first time in prison.</p>

					<p>She was in her second trimester in January when she boarded an armed bus at the Santa Ana jail for the trip to the state’s second largest women’s prison, the California Institution for Women in the desert in Chino.</p>

					<p>By March, her belly was impossible to miss. Under her perfectly sculpted eyebrows, her eyes were tired as she walked along the buildings in the hot, arid prison. She was becoming panicked.</p>

 <p>What if she went into labor in her room and the corrections officer assigned to her cellblock didn’t hear her?</p>

					<p>“I’ll be trapped in my room going through labor,” she said.</p>

					<p>That led to other fears, fed by stories from other inmates and her own imagination. Would she be handcuffed during the birth? Would the baby be whisked away by foster care officials immediately after birth? </p>

					<p>Not all stories were scary. Another inmate told her she could have a “labor coach” – someone she knew from the outside world to help her though the birth. She picked her cousin, Cari Hernandez, who she’d grown up with when her own mother was in prison. But there was a lot of paperwork.</p>

 <p>Zodiacal was due on Mother’s Day. As April stretched on, her health deteriorated and she was put her on bed rest, which meant more time in her cell. In May, she was increasingly “cranky” and “not in the mood for anyone to be around me.” </p>

					<p>Mother’s day came and went. Zodiacal was still pregnant, and the paperwork was still not complete - in part because she couldn’t scrape together the $20 she needed to notarize the guardianship papers.</p>

					<p>A week later, the contractions began. It all went as planned. Labor was in a local hospital and went by quickly – too fast for an epidural. And there were some scary moments.</p>

					<p>“The cord was around his neck,” Hernandez explained. “Poor Regina, her placenta was latched in and wouldn’t come out.”</p>

					<p>Jayden Elijah was born at 5:12 p.m. on May 18. He weighed 8 lbs. and was 20 inches long.</p>
 
					<p>No visitors were allowed. Women who are sent to the hospital to give birth are still inmates, with the same prison rules.</p>

					<p>Two later, Zodiacal was sent back to prison. Jayden was bundled up and sent home with his aunty Cari in Santa Ana.</p>


					<p class="character">Christina Bray</p>


					<p>Bray’s contractions kept getting stronger. She was still sitting in central booking at the Santa Clara County Jail (needs CQ). The sergeant all but told her it wouldn’t be the first time someone under arrest faked labor.</p>

					<p>Her husband, also under arrest, was in the next room. </p>

					<p>Around midnight, Bray was transported to WHICH hospital in San Jose. She felt the nurses on duty "judged" her. </p>

					<p>"I was in there for a crime," she said, "and police were outside monitoring the whole thing, so people were just afraid to come in and give me the service that they should have, that they would have given to anyone in labor." </p>

					<p>The baby’s heartbeat slowed, a sign of stress, so the labor had to be sped up. Bray said she was "shaking and traumatized" when Lola Mae Bray came into the world at 12:17pm on Dec 23, 2011. </p>

					<p>Mother and baby had a little over 24 hours together. On Christmas day, Christina Bray said goodbye to her 2-day-old baby. The nurse gave mother and child one last moment alone before taking Lola Mae to her grandparents. </p>

					<p>"I put her to my heart, and I told her that this is mommy’s heartbeat and I will be with you soon," she said. "Don’t ever forget about my heart."</p>
					<p>Bray was transported back to jail to finish the booking process.</p>

					<p>"No words I can find explain what jail is like," she said. </p>

					<p>Bray and her husband pleaded guilty and returned the merchandise they bought with Bellane’s money. </p>

					<p>She was sentenced to six years in prison – of which she’d serve three if she behaved well. Her husband got a longer sentence, 8 years. He had a prior conviction and a gun.</p>

					<p>As relieved as Bray was to leave the county jail, state prison was worse. </p>

					<p>"Getting on the bus and the gates opening and entering into prison, and the whole feel," she said, "it’s like your life is literally sucked out of you knowing that I’m going into prison - a level 4 prison - where you listen to all the horror stories." </p>

					<p>She knew she would do anything she could to get out of Chowchilla (prison name needs CQ) and began researching her options. She was on a mission to reunite with her daughters. </p>

	                <div class="prose">

						<p class="character">Regina Zodiacal</p>

						<p>Zodiacal calls her cousin twice a week for updates about baby Jayden. Hernandez said Zodiacal has had a rough time since the birth of her son.</p>

						<p>"She’s depressed,” Hernandez said.</p>

						<p>Corazon Navarro is the sole gynecologist assigned to the health clinic at the women’s prison in San Bernardino County. For 25 years, she has measured bellies, prescribed prenatal vitamins and seen more than a few women in the throes of post-partum depression. </p>

						<p>Every Monday, she examines up to a dozen pregnant and post-partum prisoners in the two beds set aside for gynecological care. On the walls are pictures of faded rainbows and teddy bears.</p>

						<p>On May 1, she sat with Brittany Bass, 23, who’s in prison for violating the terms of her probation on an armed robbery charge.</p>

						<p>Bass had given birth to a daughter, Alexadra Rose, 12 days earlier. She gave her up for adoption.</p>

						<p>Even though she knew her daughter would be better off with the family she chose, she said she’s still devastated. </p>

						<p>"I literally had to say goodbye to my baby and then be put in chains again,” Bass said. She’d been cradling herself in her cell ever since, not wanting to talk to anyone,"very much in my own head.” In the days before this visit, she’d find herself "crying or just very sad.”</p>

						<p>Bass was not allowed to bring back to the prison the basic post-partum care package that the hospital gives all women: Tucks wipes and a spray bottle for cooling, cleaning and numbing the vaginal area.</p>

						<p>All she had been taking for the physical pain of stitches was Motrin.  Her breasts were heavy and she asks Navarro to make the milk stop.</p>

						<p>Zodiacal likely continued seeing Navarro, too. It’s unclear how she’s fared since Jayden was born because she stopped participating in this story in May. </p>

						<p>She didn’t see him for at least a month after he was born. Until the guardianship paperwork is final, he’s not an "approved” visitor under prison rules, her cousin explained.</p>

						<p>Hernandez has signed Jayden up for WIC and MediCal, but is afraid to apply for other services for fear the Department of Children and Family Services will swoop in.</p>

						<p>Jayden’s cousin, Marie, dotes on him, carrying him around with the house, singing him songs.</p>

						<p>Zodiacal begs Hernandez to send photos. Hernandez said she often can’t because it "costs money” she doesn’t have.</p>

						<p>She is set to be released from prison in May 2014. Jayden will be almost a year old.</p>

				<p class="character">Christina Bray</p>

						<p>After a stint at Chowchilla, Bray also wound up in the California Institute for Women in Chino. </p>

						<p>Determined to find a better circumstance, she signed up for firefighting training, which is provided there. The prison was further from her daughters, but she reasoned that inmates on the fire crew get to live off-site. </p>

						<p>She also found out about a special state prison in Pomona where inmates can live with their children who are under seven years old.</p>

						<p>The Community Prisoner Mother Program is the only one of its kind. In the early 2000s, California ran another five facilities just like it. </p>

						<p>"quote on why this happned”…. Background started in the 1980s</p>

						<p>But budget constraints and efforts to reduce the prison population by transferring non-violent offenders to county supervision led prison officials to close the other ones, said Denise Johnson, TITLE.</p>

						<p>Only low-level offenders without violent crimes in their past are eligible. Zodiacal and Bass don’t qualify.</p>

						<p>But Bray would. Hopeful, she applied. </p>

						<p>She finished the months of firefighting training and was waiting to transfer to a fire camp where she’d get her first assignment, when she was accepted to the Community Prisoner Mother Program. </p>
 
						<p>As guards drove her on the prison bus (needs CQ) roughly 16 miles from Chino to Pomona, Bray began to get nervous. </p>

						<p>Is it right to bring a baby to prison? Would Lola Mae, now 13 months old, even know who she was?</p>

						<p>She pulled into a one-story cream-colored building, one of a cluster of squat brick buildings set around a large outdoor play area. There were no bars, no barbed wire and no armed guards. </p>

						<p>She’d been waiting for this moment for more than a year. Bray wanted desperately to hold her youngest daughter. </p>

						<p>"I was trying very hard not to cry, and I could feel my knees getting very weak but I didn’t want for her to get scared,” Bray recalled, "so I just held on to her and put her close to my heart.”</p>

						<p>With her grandmother next to her, Lola Mae reached out to her mother, and kissed her.</p>

						<p>Six months later, Lola appeared to be a regular, mostly happy toddler, with the usual bag full of tricks designed to get what she wants. Often that’s to go outside or get a treat from Regina Dotson, the camp’s corrections officer who keeps a jar of candy on her desk.</p>

						<p>"…” or below.</p>

						<p>She sleeps in a cot next to her mother in an open barrack shared with two other mother-child family pairs. She spends all her time inside the compound.</p>

						<p>During the day, she’s at an on-site childcare center while her mother attends classes. Mothers at the facility have to attend parenting and a few other classes. </p>

						<p>The Pomona School District (needs CQ) run preschool rooms for four-and-five year olds and a Kindergarten on the grounds. </p>

						<p>Mothers come in and out of the child centers, taking their kids for a meal in the cafeteria or reading to them before a nap. </p>

						<p>The facility is run by a non-profit, Prototypes, and it’s open to community members who are undergoing in-patient drug abuse or mental health treatment there.</p>

 <p>During a recent afternoon in July, Bray picked up Lola and took her to a play structure to burn some energy before naptime. Lola spied Dotson and instead scampered across the playground to hug her. </p>

						<p>"….”</p>
 
						<p>But Bray only has a few minutes left to get to class, so she scoops up her daughter and heads back to her room to get ready. Being late to class here is not like being late to class in the outside world. There are repercussions.</p>

						<p>She is, she never forgets, still in prison.</p>

						<h1 class="chapter">Afterword</h1>

						<div class="prose">

			                <p class="afterward">With one year left on her sentence, Bray again applied for a transfer, to an alternative to incarceration program closer to home, in the Bay Area. Prisoners at the XXX can leave during the day to work or attend school outside the facility. She was approved and transferred in September. She and Lola live in an apartment complex run by the program. She has a nightly curfew and is monitored by an ankle bracelet.</p>

				<p class="afterward">On weekends, Bray sometimes visits her three older daughters, who are living with their father near Santa Cruz. She can attend their sports matches or take them shopping. She says she’s thankful for the chance to "reunite with my family and mend the broken hearts where they have been broken.”</p>
