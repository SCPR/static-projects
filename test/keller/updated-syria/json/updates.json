If the Assad regime is able to continue to deploy chemical weapons, then to what extent will the regime have capacity to use them again?   We understand, and concur with the assertion, that specific targets of a military assault should not be shared.  Our question has to do with what Syria and the Assad regime\u2019s capacity would be expected to look like after your proposed military attack.\n \n\"Second, what would the United States do if, after a military attack, chemical weapons are used again in Syria?  What would the United States do if retaliation against Israel, Turkey, or Lebanon follows the proposed attack?\n \n\"Third, we understand from Secretary Kerry that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Arab League support taking military action.  What nations, other than France, are willing to contribute concrete effort (men, material, and arms) to this proposed military attack as opposed to mere verbal support?  Will Turkey and Saudi Arabia be actual participants in a military attack? If not, why not?  \n \n\"Assuming we attack alone or with France, where does this leave the United States if Syrian civilians die and world public opinion, especially in the Arab world, turns against the attack?  If, as Secretary Kerry notes, the world is outraged at Assad's conduct, why does it fall only to the United States to take actual military action?\n \n\"Fourth, it was noted that Russia also opposes the use of chemical weapons.  What has not been adequately addressed is what response we expect from Russia if a military attack is undertaken.  What are the immediate, short term and long term implications for US-Russian relations?\n\n\"Finally, as DNI Clapper pointed out, while we have scenarios, this would be war and events are not entirely controllable.  We understand that it might be unwise to publicly report the various scenarios that detail potential adverse consequences from a military attack although we assume that this analysis has taken place.  However, we feel we must learn of the potential adverse impacts of a military attack before a vote on authorization.  We will be available for classified briefings on this issue when Congress reconvenes in just a few days to receive these analyses.\"\n\nORIGINAL STATEMENT: \"When President Obama tells us that he has not yet made a \"decision\" on whether the U.S. military will commence hostilities with Syria, he has misunderstood his authority. As Constitutional scholars have said, including Mr. Obama himself when he was running for his office, the President should understand that it is not his decision alone to make. He is required to obtain the consent of the U.S. Congress before he engages in hostilities with Syria. To commence hostilities without statutory authorization from Congress violates the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the United States Constitution. To argue that dropping bombs on another country for a short period of time is not an act of war is foolishness.\n\nInternationally his footing is equally perilous. Without a resolution from the UN Security Council, and in the face of a request from the UN that no action commence until a full report from UN inspectors is received, America cannot commence hostilities with Syria while remaining within the bounds of international law.\n\nThe Obama administration says we must act to defend \"international norms.\" But how can we defend international norms by breaking international law?\n\nFor the President to act without Congressional authorization, without UN approval, without the support of the Arab League, and without our closest ally Great Britain, would be a serious error. The debate on the wisdom of military action, and what form it might take should we choose that option, remains to be had in the Congress of the United States, and in the context of the wishes of the American people. President Obama must not rush to action without allowing our American democracy and Constitutional system to function.\n\nLike many Members of Congress, I doubt the wisdom of initiating further hostilities in the Middle East. However, like all Members, I will approach that debate with an open mind, listen to the President, and then join with my colleagues in exercising our Constitutional and statutory authority over matters of war and peace. Only after such a debate, and only with the approval of both houses of Congress, could the President legitimately proceed.\"", "full_reference": "Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren - (D-San Jose)", "image_url": "http://a.scpr.org/i/7f5dc9362f2f29325ce012439d36fef8/54597-wide.jpg", "source": "Press Release", "source_url": "http://www.lofgren.house.gov/images/stories/pdf/09022013%20letter%20from%20reps%20anna%20eshoo-zoe%20lofgren%20to%20amb%20susan%20rice%20re%20syria.pdf", "source_date": "9/2/2013", "vote_promise": "undecided", "promise_date": null, "promise_note": "BASED ON???", "vote_outcome": null}, {"position": "Rep", "common_reference": "Congressman", "full_name": "Alan Lowenthal", "first_name": "Alan", "last_name": "Lowenthal", "party": "D", "district_id": 47, "district": "Long Beach", "view_on_syria": "\"I deplore the loss of life in Syria and condemn the violence and human rights violations.

I have opposed arming the rebels in Syria, notwithstanding the Administration's support because I fear those weapons will get in the wrong hands and it will draw us into yet another sectarian civil war. I have also always taken a strong position against the use of chemical weapons and in favor of holding those who commit such war crimes accountable. As I weigh the difficult decision on any proposed authorization to use force, I will be particularly focused on narrowing the breadth of the authorization, as well as the Administration's effectiveness in making the case to the American people and marshaling international support for military action.\"", "full_statements": "UPDATED STATEMENT: \"The President has said that Assad must be held accountable for violating the Geneva Protocol and all the international norms against chemical weapons use -- not to mention crimes against humanity. I agree with him. The President has also said that the failure to hold Assad accountable will not only encourage him to use chemical weapons again, but increase the likelihood that other nations will conclude that their development and use of WMD will be tolerated, and I agree with that too.\n\n\"I also believe that, as it is an international norm that is being violated, it is vital that the international community hold Assad accountable and that it should not be the United States acting alone. Yesterday afternoon, I expressed my concern to the White House that very few other nations were willing to act in concert with the United States in holding Assad accountable. After the loss of British support, the President faces the challenge of building a sufficiently broad coalition to satisfy the concerns of the American people who do not understand why the United States should take action if Syria's neighbors and the wider international community are unwilling.\n\n\"As a member of the body with the constitutional role of declaring war, I believe that the President was right to come to Congress for authorization, even though the delay might have some operational costs.  Given the need to act, I cannot understand why the Speaker would not call us back into session immediately -- and did not do so a week ago, once the dimensions of the atrocity in Syria were apparent.\n\n\"The White House has put forward a proposed bill authorizing the use of force that, as drafted, is far too broad and open ended, and could be used to justify everything from a limited cruise missile strike to a no fly zone and the introduction of American ground troops. As drafted, I will not support it. Having introduced a bill in Congress to sunset the existing authorization to use military force in one conflict, I am loathe to support another unless it were very narrowly drawn. In my discussion with the White House, I told them the draft would need to be reigned in significantly to have any chance of passage.\n\n\"After Iraq and Afghanistan, the American public is weary of war, and I share that weariness.
