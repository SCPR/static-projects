            <p>Tuesday night, just after the polls closed, Fernando Guerra disclosed the initial results of an election day <a href="http://studyla.org/preliminary-results/" target="blank">exit poll</a>, which predicted a victory by Eric Garcetti over Wendy Greuel by 54 percent to 46 percent.</p>
            <p>Guerra, who directs <a href="http://studyla.org/" target="blank">Loyola Marymount University's Center for the Study of Los Angeles</a>, was spot on. His numbers exactly matched the final count delivered by the L.A. City Clerk's office at 3:15 Wednesday morning.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the LMU center issued the details of the exit poll, and the results display just how much Garcetti dominated the race.</p>
            <p>The exit poll’s highlights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Garcetti won in every age group — 18-29, 30-44, 45-64 and 65+ — with at least 55 percent of the vote.</li>
                <li>Greuel won the African-American vote by a whopping 69-31 percent.</li>
                <li>He captured votes from Democrats (53-47) and Republicans as well (61-39).</li>
                <li>Garcetti dominated with male voters (60-40 percent).</li>
                <li>Garcetti won the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish votes with at least 52 percent.</li>
                <li>Greuel won among households with a resident who belongs to a public union, but her margin was .8 percent — actually a statistical tie with Garcetti.</li>
                <li>In households outside the San Fernando Valley, Garcetti won 58 percent of the vote.</li>
                <li>Garcetti won in every income category — with his margin increasing along with household income levels.</li>
            </ul>
