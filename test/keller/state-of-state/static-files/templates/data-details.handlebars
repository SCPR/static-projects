        <p>Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown delivered his third State of the State address Thursday since reclaiming office. He did so just months after voters approved his Proposition 30, which raised sales and income taxes temporarily.</p>
        <p>The main topics Brown addressed -- reform of K-12 education funding, the need for the higher education systems to hold down costs, promotion of high-speed rail and water tunnels under the San Joaquin Delta -- have been addressed previously, including in his budget proposal.</p>
