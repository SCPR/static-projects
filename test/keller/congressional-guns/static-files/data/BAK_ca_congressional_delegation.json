There is no one-stop solution to solving the problem. Rather, it should be looked at holistically. Yes, we have problems with our gun control laws; from the way that background checks are conducted to the lack of funding for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives to ensuring our law enforcement have the tools to crack down on gun trafficking to ensuring there is a reasonable limit on possessions of certain kinds of weapons and magazines. We must also ensure that there is complete parity of mental health coverage with physical health. There is, however, a need for our country to also look at the causes of violence. We must answer the question as to why our country leads the Western World in violence and gun-related deaths. The 2012 Peace Index, a yearly study done by the Institute for Economics and Peace on the cost of violence across the world, found that the least violent states in our nation had some of the highest rates of health coverage, high school graduation, educational opportunity and perceived access to basic services, as well as among the lowest rates of teen pregnancy, income inequality, poverty and infant mortality.
