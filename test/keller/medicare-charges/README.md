* Which hospital in which city has the highest average cost for a procedure.
* Which has the lowest average cost for a procedure.
* Given my zip code, show me five hospitals around me and the cost for a procedure, though that changes some things.
* Alphabetize the hospital select menus.
* Style the display of information.



1) Instead of saying "Choose a hospital" I would maybe say "Find your local hospital". It's hard to find your local hospital because it doesn't look like it's in ABC or geographical order. I wanted to compare knee surgery costs at Torrance Memorial and Little Company of Mary in Torrance, but it was really hard to find both in the drop-down.

2) When I see "lowest cost" and "highest cost" I really wonder where those hospitals are. What if someone was just looking for the place with the lowest cost? I know people who've moved out of state just to get medical services.

3) Did you know the Cleveland Cavs stadium scoreboard has not only the opponent and their teams scores, but also THE DIFF in between? It was a fan suggestion. But it reminds me we should calculate and *show* the diff. Mental math is hard sometimes. We could subtract reimbursement from cost. Maybe we could show the difference b/w the high and the low by subtracting and showing the diff, or doing a simple Google Charts img API horizontal bar chart

Which I made inspired by NYTimes yearly exec chart: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/05/business/the-highest-paid-ceos.html?ref=business&gwh=8715EC3E79CD66EF4FC3DF0E00DA3A0B (paywall)

4) Nerd question: Did you use mean (average) or median (middle value) for the average? This left me wondering whether there are extreme outliers (both at high and low) that are pulling the mean one way or another. Is it because some hospitals in expensive areas or cheaper areas lean one way or another? I want a box plot..!
