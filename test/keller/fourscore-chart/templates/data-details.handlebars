                <p>California teacher protections are unconstitutional, according to a ruling by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Tuesday. The ruling found that California teacher tenure, firing and discipline procedures are unconstitutional because they violate childrenâ€™s right to an adequate education.</p>
