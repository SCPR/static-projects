        <p>Eric Garcetti rode a wave of support in central Los Angeles to win election Tuesday as the successor to Antonio Villaraigosa as mayor of the nation’s second largest city, beating City Controller Wendy Greuel 54 to 46 percent.
        <p>According to unofficial results made available by the <a href="http://cityclerk.lacity.org/election/archives/archives2013/general/svcptotl.txt">Los Angeles City Clerk's Office</a>, Garcetti won a wide swath of precincts through LA's mid-section, and picked up precincts in the valley and the south that had gone to Greuel in March's primary.</p>
        <p>An exit poll conducted by Loyola Marymount University indicated that Garcetti won among the city's two largest voting blocs — whites and Latinos. Greuel dominated among black voters, but they only represent about 12 percent of the city's registered voters.</p>
        <p>The map below shows how Los Angeles precincts voted for the candidates in Tuesday's runoff election based on unofficial results made available by the  <a href="http://cityclerk.lacity.org/election/archives/archives2013/general/svcptotl.txt">Los Angeles City Clerk's Office</a>.</p>
