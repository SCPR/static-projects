The lower garden at the rear of the property is removed enough from street and such that you can tune out the noise of the city and be at peace.  And walking the labyrinth is very therapeutic in a way that I had never imagined.  Our lives turned upside down when a high-profile shooting robbed us of a friend right in front of our house.  When I could find a few minutes to get away while the chaos reigned, I walked the labyrinth 8 times for each of the 8 months she had lived iwth us and found myself able to settle for the first time since it happened.  Then going to the garden was like the final rub after a massage.  It helped me keep that feeling in the trying days after.",Yes

There is a Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial that contains part of his ashes, as well as a  Court of Religions that honors the five principal religions of the world (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, & Hinduism). Throughout the gardens you will find plaques with insightful phrases from various spiritual texts, paths to alcoves with benches for contemplation, a two-storied houseboat, and a hidden grotto in the cool, refreshing shade.        Overlooking the lake is a windmill with a chapel inside. The chapel is silent save for the ambient noises outside in the gardens and lake waters rippling on its shores. It's my favorite part of the Lake Shrine. The energy inside is peaceful, yet intense and welcoming. I am a novice to meditation, but I have amazing success here. I love to come here and turn down the noise on all the ""STUFF"" to help me find my inner peace. *deep breath inhale, pause, exhale*                 I wish I lived closer (I'm in the SGV) so I could visit more often, but, then again, the distance makes each visit that much more special.

I've sat there for literally hours, getting lost in thought, or thinking about nothing at all, or sitting and talking with friends. I think part of the reason it's my favorite place is because I associate it with LMU and my college years and all the wonderful people I met there - it's very familiar, which can be comforting a few years out of college. Over the years, the emotions I've felt there have run the gamut: sadness, joy, nostalgia, frustration, being completely overwhelmed, being completely content.

Ilana,Turner,,I go hiking in either the Angeles Forest. My favorite hikes in the Angeles Forest: Gabrielino Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail/Silver Moccasin Trail,,,,,"I feel like a kid exploring the wilderness, smelling the scents, noticing the seasonal changes, looking for wildlife or evidence of wildlife. It makes me feel alive! I am connected to what truly matters, things bigger than myself, and this gives me a sense of utter peace. It is one reason I'd have a hard time ever moving away. A metropolis with such access to many truly wild places. In the Angeles Forest I've been on hikes where I haven't seen a human animal, but I have seen a black bear, a bobcat, a hawk, a rattlesnake - not all at once. But this is in Los Angeles! And on the Mishe Mokwa Trail in Malibu I love to see how the seasons bring about different wildflowers and blossoms. I also find such solace with the view at Sandstone peak.",
