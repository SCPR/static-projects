            <p>Despite trying for more than a decade, state and school district educators have failed to close the gap in test scores between Latino students and other ethnic groups.</p>
            <p>It's a major problem because 52 percent of California’s public school students and as a group they scored a hundred points less than their white counterparts on California's Academic Performance Index – and more than 150 points below Asian students. Latino students as a group have never met the state goal of 800 points.</p>
            <p>But what if schools changed the style of teaching and testing? Educators have high hopes that the new Common Core standards, will improve Latino student performance. But educators are coming up against some of the same problems they say kept Latinos from raising their test scores.</p>
