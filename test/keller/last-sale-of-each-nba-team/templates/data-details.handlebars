                <p>The NBA has learned that Shelly Sterling and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer reached an agreement on the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers for a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-sn-clippers-sale-ballmer-20140529-story.html" target="blank">reported $2 billion</a>.</p>
                <p>Ballmer's $2 billion purchase of the Clippers &ndash; which Donald Sterling bought in 1981 for an estimated $12 million &ndash would nearly quadruple the previous record for the sale of a NBA team, set earlier this month when the Milwaukee Bucks sold for a <a href="http://www.nba.com/2014/news/05/15/milwaukee-bucks-sale-news-release/" target="blank">reported $550 million</a>. A sale of the Clippers franchise also means a third of the NBA's 30 teams will have changed ownership since 2010.</p>
                <p>The chart below &ndash which does not include the reported Clippers deal &ndash plots the most-recent purchase of each NBA team against their estimated purchase price <a href="http://www.forbes.com/nba-valuations/list/" target="blank">via Forbes</a>. The estimated purchase price has been adjusted for 2014 inflation. It also displays the three most-recent collective bargaining agreements &ndash in 1999, 2005 and 2011 &ndash between the NBA and the NBA Players Association.</p>
