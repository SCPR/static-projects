It's a great quiet respite from the sound and fury of Los Angeles, right in the heart of the city.  Especially good as an escape on a hot day.                   It is also a good starting (or ending) point, if you want to take one of the harder trails in the park or want to walk to down to Thai Town for some food and shopping on a Sunday afternoon.                   If you have the time and are in the mood for some walking, taking the Metro Red line is a good way to get to Ferndell (Hollywood & Western Station, go north on Western, to just north of Franklin)."}, {"firstname": "Tatiana", "lastname": "Basanez", "image": "http://a.scpr.org/i/5ed22974bde032fdbbe63cde20e0a0cf/61408-eight.jpg", "address": "La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, CA", "publish": "Contact me first.", "geocoded": "34.21055,-118.200441", "place": "Hahamongna Park in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge", "narrative": "Trees, nature, wildlife, and silence"}, {"firstname": "Dina", "lastname": "Kraemer", "image": "", "address": "Manhattan Beach, CA", "publish": "Yes.", "geocoded": "33.8847361,-118.4109089", "place": "6am Run In the sand Between Manhattan Beach Pier North or South Just one simple mile and back A slice of heaven on earth.
