Just outside those doors are bicycles whizzing by, children squawking, snippets of conversations, dogs barking and many, many cars.  But inside it is always quiet.  There is something so very comforting about this.  It's as if no matter what is going on outside in the big, loud city, or who walks through those doors, inside it is a collectively respected space.  It is shared and yet deeply personal.  It is public and private all in one.  The soothing smell of words on paper just does something to people.

There is a Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial that contains part of his ashes, as well as a  Court of Religions that honors the five principal religions of the world (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, & Hinduism). Throughout the gardens you will find plaques with insightful phrases from various spiritual texts, paths to alcoves with benches for contemplation, a two-storied houseboat, and a hidden grotto in the cool, refreshing shade.        Overlooking the lake is a windmill with a chapel inside. The chapel is silent save for the ambient noises outside in the gardens and lake waters rippling on its shores. It's my favorite part of the Lake Shrine. The energy inside is peaceful, yet intense and welcoming. I am a novice to meditation, but I have amazing success here.
