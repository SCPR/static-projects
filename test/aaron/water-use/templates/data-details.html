            <p>After months of mandatory water cutbacks in response to a historic drought, earlier this year California's Water Board asked water districts to conduct "stress tests" to determine their water needs. Most decided <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/08/16/63669/despite-drought-most-ca-water-agencies-ditch-manda/">they had enough water to get through three more years of drought</a>, and wouldn't require their customers to cut back. That's led to a bump in water use this summer compared to 2015, across much of the state. Explore the map to learn more.</p>

            <p>The GIS data here was compiled by the Department of Water Resources. Spokeswoman Lauren Bisnett said that "it comes from a wide range of sources of a wide range of qualities. There isn’t a better water agency dataset in existence to our knowledge, but ours should be considered a rough." KPCC was able to identify 385 of the districts in the monthly urban water use reports, from the State Water Resources Control Board — that's what you see below.</p>
