    <h3>How much are charter advocates spending?</h3>
    <p>A lot. Below are the ten biggest outside spenders in California legislative races this year. As of October 27, the top two spenders are both education reform groups — EdVoice and the Parent Teacher Alliance (which is linked to the California Charter Schools Association Advocates).</p>

    <h3>Which races are attracting the most money?</h3>
    <p>Below are the top ten races, ranked by the amount of outside spending they've attracted this year. The state's most expensive battle is for the 14th Assembly District, and it's already attracted more outside spending than any race in California history. That contest pits Tim Grayson against fellow Democrat Mae Torlakson. If Torlakson's name sounds familiar, that's because she's married to State Superintenddent of Education Tom Torlakson. Charter groups spent millions trying to block Tom Torlakson's re-election in 2014, and this year EdVoice has spent about $3 million (TK) trying to keep Mae Torlakson out of the open seat.</p>
    <p>Other expensive races have seen waves of spending by charter-allied groups, including the 3rd Senate District, and 27th and <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/06/21/61628/charter-group-money-flooded-local-election-but-man/">43rd Assembly District</a> races.</p>
