In a hurry to get downtown from Hollywood? Hop on the Metro's Red Line trains, which arrive to stations on schedule 99.5% of the time. Don't mind showing up late? Wait for the 2 bus, which pulls up to stops five minutes late -- or worse -- nearly a quarter of the time.

One-fifth of Metro's buses close their doors [TK--accurate] late, according to data from the agency covering the last five years. About 5% of buses on Metro's 170 bus lines show up early, and more than 75% of buses show up on time. But the definition of "on time" may surprise riders: buses defined as "on time" can be as many as five minutes late.

Metro's trains glide into stations on time far more often. Since December 2009, more than 99% of trains have arrived on time. Trains have gotten slightly more late in recent years, as the rail system has undergone rapid expansion, and changed the way it tracks late trains. But in 2014, the data show that 99.3% of trains still showed up on schedule -- or within 5 minutes of it.

Some lines are more punctual than others (embed graph of rail line lateness). Only 1 in 200 Red and Purple Line trains arrive late (the lines are tracked together; all examples cover th elast five years, unless otherwise noted).

Blue Line trains are four times more likely to show up late. About 1 in 50 of them have, the worst performance in the rail system. Metro spokesman Giancarlo Restreppo said that Blue Line trains has more street-grade crossings than other lines, making them more susceptable to street traffic. The 22-mile Blue Line was the first in the county's modern rail system, opening in 1990.

No bus line is as timely as the Metro's trains. Some are punctual, though. The 901 bus rapid transit line--which ferries commuters from Chatsworth to North Hollywood in its own dedicated lane--showed up within 5 minutes of schedule 94% of the time. The 901 is also known as the Orange Line.

On the other side of the specutrum, the 205 bus--which runs along Western, Vermont and Wilmington from San Pedro to Willowbrook--has made it to stops on schedule about 70% of the time since August 2010. That's the worst of any bus with more than 250,000 stops recorded by the Metro. (EXPLORE OUR INTERACTIVE....)

Then again, you'd have better luck on the 205 in the summer than in the fall. Over millions of stops tracked in the database, some months emerge as timelier than others for buses.

For example, less than a fifth of all Metro buses were late in July (17.5% late) and January (18%). But the numbers for October (22.1% late) and September (21.9%) are considerably worse. 

Restreppo says there's a reason for that. "October and September late rates are seasonally high due to increased ridership as most schools are  back in session. During the Summer, ridership decreases. It is easier to adhere to a schedule if there are less patrons." He cites traffic and heavy laods as the biggest challenges in keeping the buses running on time.

Buses have gotten slightly more timely in recent years, according to the data. 20.1% of the trips tracked by the the Metro in 2012 were classified as late arrivals. In 2013, that number fell to 19.2% and in 2014 it was 19.1%. The data tracks millions of stops each year, so a even the 0.1% improvement in 2014 meant that buses reached stops on schedule an additional 146,000 times.

The data, provided by the Metro in response to a Public Records Act request, tallies 74,425,377 stops by its buses and trains across Southern California. In recent years, the Metro has outfitted buses with equipment that tracks where and when they open and shut their doors. Each night, that data is downloaded from buses and matched to bus schedules to determine how many arrived early, on-time and late. 

The system ignores buses that were more than 20 minutes early or more than an hour late, and the first and last stops are also ignored.

Data collection works differently for trains. When a train arrives more than five minutes late, or is cancelled, an employee at the Rail Operations Control Center makes a paper record. Those records are eventually entered into an electronic databases. According to Restreppo, "we may miss logging one or two delays but itâ€™s a rare occurrence." The collection method changed in September 2011, and now relies less on sometimes inscrutable handwritten notes. 

Restreppo says that the price tag on the Metro's data efforts is unknown.

Richard Anderson, who studies transit at Imperial College London, says that some systems have moved towards "passenger dealy metrics", which gauge the impact of transit service for riders. Buses that are late but fairly regular may not incovenice riders, the thinking goes. The Metro doesn't track such metrics, according to Restreppo.

It's difficult to compare the on-time performance of Los Angeles' transit system to others around the country. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics doesn't collect on-time transit performance from transit agencies. Few of those agencies publicize their numbers. And methodlogies and data collection can vary widely from system to system, making them apples-to-oranges comparisons.

Data from the Orange County Transportation Authority show that buses there arrive on-time about 87% of the time, a number that has inched up in recent years. But it tracks buses differently than the Metro does in Los Angeles County [TK--true?]

The Metro [surveyed other big-city transit systems in 2008](http://media.metro.net/board/Items/2008/06_june/20080618F&BItem18.pdf), and found that it performed the worst of any agency surveyed, which included Chicago, New York and Seattle. Metro's on-time performance improved from 2009 to 2014, according to its own data.
