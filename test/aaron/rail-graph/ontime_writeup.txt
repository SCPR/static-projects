* Want to get to your destination on time? Hop on the Metro's Blue Line train. Don't mind showing up late? Wait for the bus -- especially the 130, 205 or 217.

* One-fifth of MTA buses show up to stops 5 minutes late, or later, according to data from the agency covering the last five years. About 5% of buses show up early, and more than 75% of buses show up on time. But the definition of "on time" may surprise bus riders: buses defined as "on time" can be up to five minutes late.

* The Metro's trains are far more timely than its buses. Since December 2009, more than 99% of trains have arrived on time. Trains have gotten slightly more late in recent years, as the rail system has undergone rapid expansion. But in 2014, the data show that 99.3% of trains still showed up on time.

* Some lines are more punctual than others (embed graph of rail line lateness). For example, about 1 in 50 blue line trains arrives late. But Red and Purple line trains are four times as likely to show up on time -- only 1 in 200 trains on those lines (which are tracked together) arrive late.

* No bus line is as timely as the MTA's trains. Some are punctual, though. The 901 bus rapid transit line--which ferries commuters from Chatsworth to North Hollywood in its own dedicated lane--showed up within 5 minutes of schedule 94% of the time. The 901 is also known as the Orange Line.

* On the other side of the specutrum, the 205 bus--which runs along Western, Vermont and Wilmington from San Pedro to Willowbrook--made it to stops on schedule about 70% of the time. That's the worst of any bus with more than 250,000 stops recorded by the MTA. (EXPLORE OUR INTERACTIVE....)

* Buses have gotten slightly more timely in recent years, according to the data. 20.1% of the trips tracked by the the MTA in 2012 showed up five minutes late or worse. In 2013, that number fell to 19.2% and in 2014 it was 19.1%.

* The data, provided by the MTA in response to a Public Records Act request, tallies 74,425,377 stops by its buses and trains in Southern California. In recent years, the MTA has outfitted buses with equipment that tracks where and when the vehicles open and close their doors. Each night, that data is downloaded from buses and matched to bus schedules to determine how many arrived early, on-time and late. 

* The system ignores buses that were more than 20 minutes early or more than an hour late, and the first and last stops are also ignored.

* Data collection works differently for trains. When a train arrives more than five minutes late, or is cancelled, an employee at the Rail Operations Control Center makes a paper record. Those records are eventually brought into an electronic system [TK--confirm how this is done]. According to spokesman Giancarlo Restreppo, "we may miss logging one or two delays but itâ€™s a rare occurrence."

* The MTA's on-time performance compares TK to other cities...in some way. (FTA data?...still havent heard from them. Also tried to get Orange County data, still waiting on that). The MTA's on-time performance rate for buses lags behind other transit systems, including Washington DC's Metro and Orange County. Many transit systems do not publish on-time performance data to their websites. When the MTA surveyed other large transit departments in 2008, it found that it ranked the lowest of any agency surveyed, including New York, Seattle and Chicago.
