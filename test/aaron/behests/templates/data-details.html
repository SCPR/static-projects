            <p>While Los Angeles has tight controls on the amount of money citizens can donate to campaigns, there's no limit on the amounts of cash people, foundations, non-profits and corporations can donate to government and charities at a politician's behest.</p>

            <p>Since Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was elected in 2013, he has reported nearly $30 million in payments at his behest. The majority of those payments have gone to The Mayor's Fund For Los Angeles, a non-profit dedicated to promoting civic causes including reducing homelessness, workforce development and gang reduction. You can explore the donors and recipients of the money below.</p>

            <p><strong>Source</strong>: Los Angeles City Ethics Commission. Names of some donors have been standardized to group related entities. Law only requires payments totaling greater than $5,000 in a single year by a donor to be reported by politicians. Donors with less than $200,000 in behested payments since May 2013 and who only donated to a single organization have been grouped together below.
