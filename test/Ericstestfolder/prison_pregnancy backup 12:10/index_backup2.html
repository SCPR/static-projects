                    <p>Ruby is among a growing number of Los Angeles kids whose parents are choosing to place them in immersion schools not to learn English, but to learn a foreign language&mdash;sometimes one that isn&#8217;t spoken at home.</p>
                    <p>In her case, it&#8217;s the Spanish immersion program at Micheltorena, which her mother Amy describes as &#8220;Silverlake hipster school.&#8221;</p>
                    <p>They are breaking with the long-held fear that learning two languages at once would retard a child&#8217;s English vocabulary, instead gravitating to immersion schools as a way to bolster their children&#8217;s education. There is such an interest by parents that the number of bilingual schools in California has increased five-fold since 1994.</p>

                    <p>&#8220;Each time the child hears a word, we take a snapshot of the brain activity over the next two seconds after hearing the word,&#8221; explained Barbara Conboy, a Linguistics professor at Redlands University who&#8217;s been studying multiple language acquisition for years.</p>
                    <p>Conboy is looking for differences in activity between when a child hears a &#8220;known&#8221; word&mdash;one he or she would immediately recognize, such as dog, or cat&mdash;and unknown words.</p>
                    <p>What she and others have found is that by a certain age, a child is able to tell whether a word he or she has never heard before is a word in his or her native language.</p>
                    <p>A 3-year-old English speaker probably does not know the word &#8220;fiber,&#8221; but Conboy said brain snapshots reveal that the child is able to figure out that it is an English word.</p>
                    <p>And&mdash;what&#8217;s most relevant to parents of children exposed to multiple languages&mdash;is children can make that distinction even if they speak more than one language. A 3-year-old who also speaks Spanish would know that &#8220;fiber&#8221; is English and not Spanish based solely on the pattern or sound structure of the word, Conboy said.</p>
                    <p>She said that&#8217;s because the infant brain is meant to discover patterns in the sounds it hears.</p>
                    <p>Children can begin to make language distinctions in unknown words from the time they are four months old, said Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a professor at Temple University and Director of its Infant Language Laboratory.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;Babies are brilliant,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In the first year of life, babies discriminate the sounds from all of the world&#8217;s languages and they become specialists in finding the words and sounds in their own native tongue.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>Spoken words stimulate the infant brain to try to understand what it&#8217;s hearing. That causes lots of neurons to fire to try to fit the word into a language.</p>
                    <p>As a result, researchers said, bilingual children may actually get smarter. Conboy said they get a boost in the part of the brain that controls &#8220;executive function&#8221;&mdash;working memory, focus and mental flexibility.</p>
                    <p>MRIs and electrode cap activity in bilingual infants and toddlers shows more activity in this area of the brain in children who speak multiple languages, according to Loyola Marymount University professor Magaly Lavadenz.</p>
                    <p>She says that mental activity that works a child&#8217;s executive functions, such as language-learning, helps the child be more focused.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;The brain is like a muscle,&#8221; she said, &#8220;like any muscle, the more you use your muscle, the stronger it is.&#8221;</p>
                    <p>Jan Corea, who runs the California Association of Bilingual Education, said social science research from the last decade is proving that if a child can learn two languages they will &#8220;do much better in academic achievement tests&#8221; over the life of their education.</p>
                    <p>Researchers looking at brain activity have also figured out why a child can learn multiple languages much more easily than adults.</p>
                    <p>Lavadenz said that as infants get older and are only exposed to certain languages, &#8220;we delete those other language sound systems.&#8221;</p>
                    <p>The brain begins to focus more exclusively on what it is hearing, losing the ability to understand different languages. Conboy said this process is called &#8220;neural commitment.&#8221;</p>
                    <p>The brain is committing itself to the languages it is hearing. So the younger a child is, the more the brain will be open to trying to process new sounds and languages.</p>
                    <p>The younger brain is simply working on it more than an older child or adult as the child has still not become completely entrenched in a language.</p>
                    <p>But as children hear only one language, they &#8220;delete&#8221; other language systems from their brain, according to Professor Lavadenz.</p>
                    <p>That&#8217;s why kids who are older when they are immersed in a language they&#8217;ve never heard before can struggle. It can require more motivation from the child to stick with it.</p>

                    <p>Los Angeles County leads the state in the number of schools that offer bilingual education starting in kindergarten&mdash;in part, advocates and others said, because of its multicultural population. Bilingual schools have quietly built a fan-base, starting with the linguists and social scientists who have studied their progress over the last few decades, and many English-speaking parents who want their child to master a second language early in life.</p>
                    <p>After Tracy Pumilia enrolled her son in a Spanish immersion Kindergarten class, he would come home daily and try to explain to her that she had made a grave mistake. He&#8217;d say: &#8220;Mom, you don&#8217;t understand, I&#8217;m going into this classroom, but I&#8217;m supposed to be over there because that is where the English speaking kids are.&#8221;</p>
                    <p>Pumilia said he was genuinely confused about why he wasn&#8217;t with the English speaking teacher, given that was all he had ever spoken. Today, he&#8217;s a freshman in high school and is fluent in Spanish and English and Pumilia is the principal of an immersion school.</p>

                    <p>In 90-10, the students start kindergarten with 90 percent of the day being taught in the &#8220;target language&#8221;&mdash;the language that is not English&mdash;and 10 percent of the day in English. In first grade that percentage changes to 80-20; to 70-30 in second grade. By 5th grade the child is studying half the day in English and half the day in the target language.</p>
                    <p>In the 50-50 model, the instruction is split evenly between English and the target language from kindergarten.</p>
                    <p>No matter what the model, teachers stick to speaking only one language to students at the kindergarten or first grade level so the child will not slip into English.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;About the middle of first grade a child will realize that a person can speak two languages,&#8221; said Vicki Atikian Avilia, Principal at the Franklin Magnet School in Glendale. Until then, it&#8217;s crucial that students hear and try to speak only the target language.</p>

                    <p>Parents are warned to expect lower test results in the child&#8217;s first years. That&#8217;s because standardized tests are given in English starting in the second-grade, when children in 90-10 programs would have had very little English language instruction. The low second grade test score can be alarming for parents and lower the school API score but experts said that&#8217;s not a fair assessment of how well the kids are doing academically.</p>
                    <p>They become literate in the target language, but are not tested on that knowledge. Like any program, some children won&#8217;t take to it at all. But by 4th and 5th grade, bilingual students are generally doing equal to or better than their English-only peers, experts said.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;They are made to absorb as many languages as possible,&#8221; said Ana Flores, author of the book <em>Bilingual is Better</em>. Her own daughter attends Franklin Magnet school in Glendale and at the first grade level is getting 80 percent of her day in Spanish at school&mdash;as well as 100 percent of her home time. For her, learning only one language is &#8220;like being born with two arms and only teaching you how to use one.&#8221;</p>
                    <p>For this series, KPCC visited eight centers&mdash;from a day care center, to public and private elementary schools where children as young as two are being taught in a foreign language. Here are profiles of each of them.</p>

                <p>Marcos Aguilar is a principal on a mission. As a student in the 1980s, he waged battles to bring Chicano studies to UCLA. Later, as a public school teacher, he witnessed veteran teachers use the same curriculum year after year, yet blame students for failing to learn.</p>
                <p>His two passions came together in 2001, when he and his wife, also a teacher and Chicana activist, founded an indigenous language charter school.</p>
                <p>Aguilar said his goal is to "educate the community's children," to make sure they love learning and&mdash;just as importantly&mdash;to allow them to daydream.</p>
                <p>He chose Nahuatl, the most common indigenous language on the North American continent, as one of the three languages of instruction across the Semillas Community schools, which go from k-12 and also offer an international Baccalaureate program. Between two and three million people speak Nahuatl. Entire villages in the Mexican highlands speak only Nahuatl, he said. His schools teach not only the language, but also indigenous history.</p>
                <p>"We're not visitors here, and it's important for our children to grow, knowing what our ancestors named the places around us many many years ago," he said. The school is open to all children, but has a predominantly indigenous student body.</p>
                <p>Aguilar said the school graduated 100 percent of its first class last year. Of those, 80 percent went on to college.</p>
