                        <p>As Iraq's security forces continue to struggle to contain a largescale invasion by the Sunni militant group ISIS, the California delegation's response to sending military advisers to the area can be summed up in one word - "reluctant." In fact, the first response you hear when you bring up the topic is a loud sigh. </p> 

<p>Still, there are differences of opinion. Several California representatives oppose the President's decision to send military advisors. Others would like to see more done. </p>

<p> Where does your representative stand?</p>
