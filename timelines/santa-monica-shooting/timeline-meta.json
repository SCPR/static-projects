As the house burst into flames, the man, wearing what appeared to be a ballistic jacket, carjacked a woman at gunpoint and directed her to drive to the college campus, having her stop so he could shoot along the way. In all, at least 5 were left dead and several injured. Here's a timeline of Friday's events.</p>", "credits": "KPCC staff and <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/about/people/staff/michelle-lanz\">Michelle Lanz</a>", "kicker": "Crime & Safety", "published": "Published June 7, 2013"}]
