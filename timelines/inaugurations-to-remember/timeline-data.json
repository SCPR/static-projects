However, his inauguration marks an important moment in American history: a peaceful transition of power.

Feelings also weren't good between Andrew Jackson and his predecessor, John Quincy Adams. Adams didn't bother attending Jackson's inaugural ceremony. The 1828 campaign had been bitter, going so far as Jackson blaming verbal attacks from Adams and his political allies for the death of Jackson's wife.
