After first serving from 1975-83, he returned to the state's highest office in 2011, inheriting a financial crisis that had almost paralyzed the state. But much has changed in three years as the state is in better ecomomic shape. Brown recently finished taking action on bills sent to him this year by the state legislature, putting his stamp on the Democrat-controlled legislature. He is expected to run again next year, when he will be 76 years old.</p>", "credits": "Produced by Monica Luhar", "kicker": "Politics", "published": "Published Oct. 17, 2013"}]
