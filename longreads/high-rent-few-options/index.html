                    <div class="bound prologue">

                        <p>In Southern California &ndash; a region where most residents can't afford to buy a house &ndash; rents are the least affordable they've ever been, and the trend is likely to worsen.</p>

                        <p>Those are just two conclusions from recent studies of Southern California's housing market by the California Housing Partnership Corporation and Harvard University.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;The rental market in Southern California is the least-affordable it&rsquo;s ever been,&rdquo; said Richard K. Green, Director of the <a href="http://lusk.usc.edu/">USC Lusk Center for Real Estate</a>. &ldquo;We have had essentially no new supply of apartments until quite recently so vacancy rates are very low, and that gives landlords a lot of pricing power so they can push rents, and they have to the point where they&rsquo;re beyond record levels.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>There are an estimated <a href="http://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B25003&geo_ids=05000US06037,05000US06059,05000US06065,05000US06071,05000US06111">5.7 million places to live in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties</a>, according to data estimates available from the U.S. Census Bureau. About 48 percent of those housing units are occupied by renters.</p>

                        <p>The trends cited in the studies are alarming for residents who have few choices other than to pay higher percentages of their income for a place to live:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>From 2000-2012, the inflation-adjusted median rent shot up by nearly 25 percent in L.A. County, according to the <a href="http://www.chpc.net/">CHPC</a>, a non-profit created by the state to advocate for affordable housing.</li>
                            <li>During the same time, inflation-adjusted income declined by 9 percent, according to the CHPC.</li>
                            <li>About 20 percent of California households spent more than half of their income on rent in 2011, more than triple what it was in 2000, according to the CHPC.</li>
                            <li>California has the <a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/02/california-home-ownership-continues-slide-now-second-lowest.html">second-lowest home ownership rate in the country</a>, just behind New York.</li>
                            <li>More than half of Americans in rental units now spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent, which is an all-time high, according to a <a href="http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/jchs.harvard.edu/files/jchs_americas_rental_housing_2013_1_0.pdf">Harvard University study</a> released in <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/economy/2013/12/09/15356/economist-southern-california-worst-place-in-u-s-t/">late 2013</a>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>&ldquo;We are losing ground rapidly against a chronic problem that forces households to cut essential spending,&rdquo; Eric Belsky, Managing Director of the <a href="http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/">Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard</a> said in a statement.</p>

But for many these days, with rents higher than they've ever been in Southern California, the 30 percent rule is a distant fantasy.

            <p>&ldquo;L.A. actually does stand out as having the highest share of people renting which in part is a reflection of the high housing costs in the area and a younger population as well,&rdquo; said Chris Herbert, Research Director at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.</p>

            <p>Paying more for rent means residents don’t have much money left to spend on other things, which hurts the overall economy.</p>

            <p>From 2000-2012, the percentage of owners decreased in L.A. County by about 2 percent while the percentage of renters increased by about the same amount, according to the California Housing Partnership Corporation. That&rsquo;s partly because for many renters, saving up to buy a house has become cost prohibitive.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Saving for a down payment is nearly impossible if you’re paying half of your income in rent,&rdquo; said Green.</p>

            <p>KPCC spent the last few weeks talking to renters in different parts of Los Angeles about living in a city where owning an apartment often comes with the cost of squeezing savings accounts dry.</p>

            <p>Walk past a metal gate, through a small yard with a lemon tree, and up a flight of stairs, and you reach Chris Payne&rsquo;s rather cramped two-bedroom apartment in Hollywood. As much as he&rsquo;d like to at age 28, Payne couldn&rsquo;t even think about living here by himself so he splits the $1450 rent with a roommate, and even then, Payne has almost nothing left after he writes his rent check.<br />

            <p>&ldquo;I just calculated it, and it&rsquo;s about 93 percent of my paycheck that goes to rent,&rdquo; said Payne.</p>

            <p>That&rsquo;s before the tips Payne receives at the caf&eacute; where he works the counter, which can bring the percentage to a slightly more reasonable 60 or 70 percent of his net income. But either way you look at it, he has to stick to a tight budget, which means rarely eating out and limiting his purchases to the occasional music album.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>I guess I don&rsquo;t care a lot about owning a lot of stuff, so that helps.&rdquo; <cite>Chris Payne, Hollywood</cite></blockquote>

            <p>In Silver Lake, Joe Rezendes shares a 400 square-foot apartment with his boyfriend.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so small here,&rdquo; said Rezendes. &ldquo;Everything here has a function, and if it doesn&rsquo;t have a function it can&rsquo;t be in here.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Rezendes feels fortunate to be paying just over $1100 a month in rent &ndash; a bargain in trendy Silver Lake &ndash; but it still eats up about half what he takes home every month working as a fulfillment manager.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m struggling, but I know that I&rsquo;m living paycheck to paycheck,&rdquo; said Rezendes, who at 40 would love to be living in a house by now, or at least a bigger apartment. He spends so much on rent, he knows it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>

            <p>You can&rsquo;t be paying that much and trying to save for a house and trying to live the American dream&hellip;you just can&rsquo;t do that anymore," said Rezendes,<p>

            <p>After a month of searching for something more affordable, Amy Ripley recently settled on an $1100 one-bedroom apartment in Echo Park, an improvement from the $1290 studio in Atwater Village where she lived before. Still, half her paycheck disappears every month.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Saying goodbye to over half your pay every month is really hard, but that&rsquo;s just the reality of it I guess,&rdquo; said Ripley. &ldquo;I have virtually no savings, which is hard to admit, but it&rsquo;s true. All my money goes to bills and rent.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Ripley, who works an office job, says saving for a down payment isn&rsquo;t something she even thinks about right now; She&rsquo;s tried to pare down her expenses as much as possible just to make rent.</p>

            <blockquote>I rarely go out with friends. We usually do girls night in. Eating out at restaurants isn&rsquo;t very common. I rarely go shopping. There&rsquo;s definitely cutbacks, but to me it&rsquo;s worth it because the place you live, so much of your time is spent there. <cite>Amy Ripley, Echo Park</cite></blockquote>

            <p>For our last stop meeting renters in Los Angeles, we took the elevator up to Amika Sodhi&rsquo;s modern seventh floor, 1400 square foot apartment downtown.</p>

            <p>Sodhi loved living in the bustling financial district for the past year and a half.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the lifestyle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can walk to the grocery store. It&rsquo;s two blocks away. It&rsquo;s exciting to be downtown when it&rsquo;s booming.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>It was also expensive. Sodhi was spending close to half the monthly paycheck she earns working for a manufacturing technology company on rent, and that was before her landlord told her the rent was going up by several hundred dollars.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Even if I was making twice what I&rsquo;m making now, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to live here,&rdquo; said Sodhi.</p>

            <p>So, the 28-year-old made the difficult decision to move back in with her parents in Covina.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;m moving home as a real adult which I think is tough,&rdquo; said Sodhi. &ldquo;It almost feels like I&rsquo;m regressing, but I can&rsquo;t just pour all my hard work into a rental property.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>A recent study from the National Association of Home Builders found the share of 25- to 34-year-olds living with their parents went from 12-percent in 1990-2005 to more than 19-percent in 2012.</p>

            <p>Being a renter for the better part of decade has depleted Sodhi&rsquo;s savings account. By living at home, she hoped to start putting aside enough for a down payment.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s what the next step needs to be, unless I want to be a renter for the rest of life, which I don&rsquo;t want to be,&rdquo; said Sodhi.</p>

            <p>But that will have to wait. Living with her parents lasted just three weeks. Sodhi recently decided to move back downtown, to a small studio in the historic core district. It&rsquo;s eating up half her paycheck, and now she&rsquo;s trying to take on freelance copywriting gigs to help afford the rent.</p>
