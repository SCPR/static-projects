            <p>The lure of the California dream was that it was within reach.</p>
            <p>In the words of the late-historian Kevin Starr, the state offered: &quot;the highest possible life for the middle classes.&quot; </p>

            <p>By the mid-1970s that dream was in peril. Housing prices and property taxes spiked. Homeowners worried they wouldn&rsquo;t be able pay their bills. In 1978, voters backed Proposition 13. At its core, it was a vote to preserve the California dream of owning and keeping a home. </p>

            <p>Forty years later, that election continues to shape the state. </p>

            <p>Prop. 13 changed the formula for funding schools, libraries and other public programs. It influenced the building of houses and commercial properties. To this day, Prop. 13 plays an outsized role in who can afford to live here and what it costs to own a home.</p>

            <p>So did Prop. 13 save the California dream or spoil it? Or, as in many things, do we need to think more in shades of gray? To answer those questions, we focused on a single block in a middle-class neighborhood in North Oakland.</p>

            <p>That&rsquo;s where we found stories you could hear on almost any block, almost anywhere in the state. </p>

          <div class="title">What is Prop. 13?</div>
          <div class="subhed">What you need to know</div>

          <p>Californians passed Proposition 13 in June 1978 with 63 percent of the vote. The constitutional amendment fundamentally changed how both state and local governments work. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Property tax cap:</strong> Prop. 13 caps local property taxes at 1 percent of a property&rsquo;s assessed value. The assessed value can&rsquo;t grow more than 2 percent a year, meaning property taxes are pegged to a home&rsquo;s original purchase price, not what the home is currently worth. </p></li>

            <div class="image-block inline-image">
              <img src="images/history-prop-13-wins.jpg" alt="">
              <div class="cutline">(Oakland Public Library archives)</div>
            </div>

            <li><p><strong>No distinction between residential and commercial properties:</strong> The same property tax cap that applies to homeowners also applies to the land businesses and landlords own.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Property taxes only change with new owners or new construction:</strong> When someone buys a house, the house is reassessed at its new purchase price. From then on, the Prop. 13 property tax limits apply. </p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Tougher for the state to pass taxes:</strong> Prop. 13 requires any state tax to be approved with two-thirds of both houses of the legislature. </p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Tougher for cities and counties to pass local taxes:</strong> Prop. 13 required two-thirds voter approval for any tax levied by local governments that was designated for a special purpose, like parks or roads.</p></li>
          </ul>

              <p>Our neighborhood in North Oakland benefits a lot from Prop. 13. Homeowners there save nearly $2 million because of it &mdash; about $2,000 per house. Of course that&rsquo;s $2 million less that local governments receive for things like schools, parks and roads. </p>

              <p>Because of Prop. 13, property taxes in California are based on what you paid for your house instead of what it&rsquo;s worth. That means the benefit of Prop. 13 is unevenly spread out around the state: some places get huge breaks on their property taxes, while others ... not so much. </p>

              <p>With the help of the real estate data company Zillow, we&rsquo;ve mapped as many neighborhoods as we could in California to estimate where Prop. 13 is most valuable to homeowners and costly to local governments. You can search for your neighborhood below, and see how it compares.</p>

        <div class="block-chatter">
          <p>Every house on this block has at least one thing in common: They’re all worth a lot of money. The median property value was three quarters of a million dollars last year. The cheapest property &mdash; a 2 bed, 1 bath 825-square-foot bungalow &mdash; was worth $630,000 in 2017. </p>

          <p>In most states, the property tax you pay depends on how much your house is worth now. The nicer the home, the more you pay. But because of Prop. 13, property taxes in California are pegged to the value of a house when it was purchased.</p>

          <p>That’s why owners on this block pay such wildly different property taxes for very similar properties. Decades-long owners of a 1,300 square foot home on one end of the block paid $1,168 in property taxes last year. New homeowners with a smaller home on the other end of the block paid almost ten times that amount. Two very similar homes, two incredibly different property tax bills. </p>

          <p>Why does that matter? Critics of Prop. 13 say it starves local governments of much needed revenue. Cumulatively, the 41 properties we’ve mapped on this block paid $201,753 in property taxes last year. That money went into a variety of local government services, including schools, public transportation, and parks. If Prop. 13 hadn’t passed and California properties were taxed at market value, these 41 homes would pay an additional $130,000.</p>

          <p>As defenders of Prop. 13 are quick to point out, one local government’s lost revenue is another taxpayer’s savings. Without Prop. 13, many of the homeowners on the block would see their property taxes rise upwards of $5,000 a year. That includes a handful of  seniors who have owned property on the block for decades. </p>

          <p><strong>Data sources &amp; methodology:</strong> <br/>Property tax data from Alameda County Assessor and Zillow. Property value estimates from Zillow. Both property tax and property value figures from 2017, the most recent year reliable property tax data is available. Owner/renter designation derived from whether property homeowner claimed homeowner exemption. Estimated property taxes paid “without Prop. 13” were calculated by taking 1 percent of the 2017 Zillow market value estimate. “Property taxes paid” include parcel taxes, special assessments and debt service taxes that cumulatively rise above the 1 percent cap imposed by Prop. 13. Property owners who would pay less in property taxes if taxed only on market value are excluded from overall revenue estimates. </p>

              <p class="about-the-story">Prop. 13 has helped Dorothy stay in her home. But it’s done nothing to help Darrell, who is being kicked out by his landlord. And it hasn’t stopped rapid change in the neighborhood.</p>

              <p class="about-the-story">Ken is a big beneficiary of Prop. 13 on this block. Prop. 5, on this year’s ballot, would let him take his tax benefit with him if he ever decides to move.</p>
