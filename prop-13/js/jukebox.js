          "11":"Like many California millennials, she struggled to find a place she could afford.",
          "14":"Well, I looked for about a year. I would say I bid on about 10 houses, and I was outbid all cash almost every time.",
          "25":"Jas finally landed this house in North Oakland two years ago.",
          "28":"It was pricey — $850,000. And on top of her mortgage, there was the hefty property tax bill.",
          "34":"I was expecting it, but I was wasn’t expecting how much it would be, I guess.",
          "39":"Jas paid nearly $13,000 in property taxes last year. Way more than her neighbor around the corner.",
          "46":"(Sounds of tree pruning.)",
          "46":"Don Weinger cleans up the backyard of the duplex he owns just 300 feet from Johl’s place.",
          "50":"So, I pruned off all of that jasmine vine. And I pruned off all of the boughs overhanging my yard from my neighbor’s tree.",
          "60":"Weinger bought the property in 2002, for $365,000. When he checked Zillow recently...",
          "65":"It was between $850,000 and $920,000. My mouth fell open, I was shocked.",
          "71":"But even though his duplex is worth the same amount as Jas’s new house, Don paid only $7,000 last year.",
          "77":"Under Prop. 13, homeowners pay property taxes based on the price when they bought their home, not what it’s currently worth. ",
          "84":"And Don’s not the only homeowner getting a big break from Prop. 13 on this block--there are longtime homeowners with property taxes of barely $1,000.",
          "91":"Like I said the house next to me is a mirror image, and if he bought it today for $900,000, he’d be paying taxes on $900,000 and I’d be paying taxes on $365,000. So that seems very unfair.",
          "104":"But, at the same time...",
          "106":"Yeah I don’t want my taxes to go up.",
          "109":"In this gentrifying part of Oakland, a lot of the benefit of Prop. 13 goes to older people of color who bought in the '70s and '80s. ",
          "114":"But across the state, Prop. 13 means richer, often white homeowners are getting the most benefit.",

          "139":"The street was full of liquid amber trees in the fall. And they looked beautiful, so I looked at the house and I could afford it and decided to purchase it.",
          "149":"She thought it was just wrong she was paying more in property taxes than people who bought when the market was cheaper. Especially people richer than her. ",
          "156":"Stephanie’s an attorney, so after she got her first property tax bill, she did what lawyers do — she sued, arguing that Prop. 13 is unconstitutional. ",
          "163":"Her case went all the way to the Supreme Court. ",
          "166":"This is equal protection under the law, which the U.S. Supreme Court failed to implement, but it is equal protection under the law. We got one justice on that.",
          "178":"She lost, 8-1. The Supreme Court basically said Prop. 13 might be bad policy, but it wasn’t unconstitutional.",
          "184":"Thirty years later, Stephanie could be the poster child for Prop. 13. She’s a senior citizen living mostly on savings, and she saves a ton of money on her property taxes.",
          "193":"Her house is worth around $900,000 and she pays just $3,400.",
          "199":"But she's still not a fan of Prop. 13. ",
          "201":"When I was a kid California was on top. Some parts of California are perfect, and very nice, and as good as anything in the world. But other parts of California are just not what they should be.",

          "17":"We talked a lot about public schools in Oakland, what our options were.",
          "26":"They were loaded conversations. Charles grew up in Oakland and went to a public elementary school here. He has bad memories. ",
          "32":"It was the '80s, a few years after Proposition 13 passed.",
          "35":"We didn’t have any money! ",
          "37":"Michael Kirst is President of the State Board of Education - he was president back when Prop. 13 passed in 1978, too.",
          "44":"He says before Prop. 13 school districts were funded mostly by local property taxes. When Prop. 13 slashed property tax revenue,",
          "53":"The state said well we've got to bail out the local school districts, they have to open",
          "58":"But the state couldn’t make up all the lost funding.",
          "60":"They immediately dropped summer schools and adult education, then they cut vocational education, counseling. They cut assistant principals, librarians. We cut sports. Oh they cut the band!",
          "74":"That was the backdrop when Charles was an Oakland elementary school student.",
          "78":"I learned how to survive. But I can't tell you that I learned how to read and write and do arithmetic. ",
          "82":"Today, most students at Charles and Sarah’s local school, Sankofa Academy, aren’t doing well either. Only about 10 percent meet state math and English standards.",
          "93":"Sarah toured the school anyway. She loved the beautiful library, but there was no librarian. She talked to a teacher who sounded frustrated and overwhelmed. The teachers she liked …",
          "103":"They said oh well we don't actually know if we're going to be here next year. So then it turned out that there was no principal -- they hadn't had a principal all year.",
          "110":"It felt familiar.",
          "112":"After the tour, parents stood around on the front steps with crinkled brows.",
          "115":"You could tell they're all kind of trying to act like they're really considering the school. But you can tell that they're really not and they're thinking oh my gosh what are our options now.",
          "124":"There’s a lot more going on here than Prop. 13 - there’s segregation by race and class, a history of financial mismanagement and turnover in this district.",
          "134":"But San Diego State professor Jennifer Imazeki, who studies the economics of K-12 education, says education spending in California has never really recovered from Prop. 13.",
          "145":"In one fell swoop it really decimated the amount of money available to schools at the local level.",
          "151":"She says in the '70s, on average, we were a high spending state and a high performing state.",
          "156":"We are now a low spending state and a low performing state",
          "160":"Michael Kirst says Prop. 13 has had other affects, too",
          "164":"I think it contributed to a loss of confidence in public education.",
          "168":"And, as funding shifted to the state, so did control.",
          "172":"People lost a feeling of ownership of their schools. They’re kind of out of control ruled by the people up there in Sacramento.",
          "180":"Sarah and Charles want better for their local school, and don’t know how to make that happen.",
          "184":"I mean I love this community. I want to invest in this community. I want to fully be a part of this community.",
          "190":"But in the end, they decided to send their son to a private school. A lot of Oakland parents make similar choices to forgo their neighborhood schools."

          "30":"It’s a converted basement — I checked with the landlord. Michelle pays about $2,000 a month for it. That’s two-thirds of the take-home pay she gets as a librarian.",
          "39":"Places like Oakland haven’t built enough housing to keep up with demand. There are lots of reasons for this—NIMBYism, broken state housing laws, high construction costs.",

          "76":"For a bunch of weeds bounded by a chain-link fence, it’s worth a lot, says housing economist Ralph McLaughlin.",
          "82":"Oh just, as a rough guess, that parcel maybe between half a million and seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",
          "89":"That’s where Prop. 13 comes in. Because it limits property tax growth to 2 percent per year, the owners of vacant lots don’t have much reason to sell them to homebuilders.",
          "99":"In other markets where Prop. 13 policies aren’t in effect, the taxes on that property would continue to go up with the land value. And that incentivizes   development, it  increases holding costs, it makes it more expensive to hold it vacant.",
          "112":"Just a few miles from here there’s a bigger, boxier example of how Prop. 13 could be limiting the supply of new housing.",
          "118":"(Sound of cashier ringing up items.)",
          "120":"The lines in this Target in Emeryville are long for a Monday night. Steve Scherf is miserable.",
          "125":"My sinuses just clenched up in there. I hate it so bad I can barely breathe.",
          "129":"Steve may not like Target, but Emeryville and Oakland love it. That’s because both get a cut of the sales tax, which after Prop. 13 they rely on.",
          "136":"Say a city like Emeryville is deciding between approving a new big box store or a new apartment building. With the store, the city will get way more revenue. And it won’t have to pay for as many schools or librarians or infrastructure. ",
          "148":"Target is gonna win hands down.",
          "150":"McLaughlin says this more theory than something that’s been proven by research. And experts say it’s a bigger deal in the suburbs. ",
          "159":"But cities do look for other ways to replace money they lost from Prop. 13. And ironically, some of that money comes from new housing.",

          "172":"Darin Ranelletti is in charge of housing security for the city of Oakland. ",
          "177":"Most new housing in California has to pay what’s called an “impact fee”. That’s what cities charge developers to cover infrastructure costs--costs that used to be paid for with property taxes.",
          "186":"In Oakland, most of the impact fee goes to an affordable housing fund.",
          "190":"The fee recently went up in July of this year, and it ranges from $10,000 a unit, up to a max of $28,000 per unit.",
          "199":"Oakland’s fees are relatively low. But some cities charge way more. ",
          "203":"So the problem is if a fee is set to high, you could cause construction to slow down,  so you’re contributing to the housing shortage.",
