            <h2>Capital Appreciation Bonds</h2>
            <p>Thanks to voter-approved initiatives California school districts have been in building boom for the past decade. To finance projects such as new playgrounds and building upgrades, some school districts have increasingly relied on Capital Appreciation Bonds, which have left them billions of dollars in debt. State officials are now scrambling to regulate the financial tool.</p>
            <p>Much like a deal at a retail store that promises "No Payments for 18 Months," CABs allow a school district to defer payments into the future instead of making immediate and regular payments.</p>
            <p>California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer says that by deferring payment -- sometimes by 20, 30 years -- districts could end up owing up to 20 times what they originally borrowed. Lockyer is urging state legislators to put a stop to the use of CABs, and plans to meet with school administrators and their financial advisors to limit the use of the risky bonds.</p>
            <p>Until the recent real estate meltdown, it was unusual for schools to issue CABs. Plummeting property values reduced tax dollars available for schools, leading to the increase in their use.</p>
