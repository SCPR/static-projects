    <h1>Eric Garcetti pulls ahead in money race for Los Angeles' mayor</h1>
    <p>Los Angeles City Councilman Eric Garcetti pulled ahead in the money race for mayor, according to campaign contribution records filed Jan. 10. Garcetti raised more than $727,000 over the final three months of 2012.</p>
    <p>This latest haul brings Garcettiâ€™s total campaign war chest to $3.6 million. With the matching funds he is entitled to receive, he has amassed $4.2 million for the contest.</p>
    <p>Controller Wendy Greuel raised close to that amount, with a total of $3.4 million. With matching funds, Greuel has also crossed the $4 million threshold. During the previous reporting period that ended Sept. 31, Garcetti and Greuel each had $2.8 million.</p>
    <p>Garcetti and Greuel are on track to break the fundraising record for an L.A. mayoral primary, set by Antonio Villaraigosa and Jim Hahn in 2001.</p>
