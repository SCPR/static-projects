        <p>As the March 5 city election gets closer, candidates are required to file campaign finance reports more frequently. In reports submitted Thursday — covering just the first 19 days in January —  City Controller Wendy Greuel collected more than fellow frontrunner Councilman Eric Garcetti.</p>
        <p>Greuel pulled in $127,500 and Garcetti $80,500 during the period. They've been fundraising since 2011 and remain quite close: Garcetti has pulled in $3.68 million, Gruel $3.6 million.</p>
