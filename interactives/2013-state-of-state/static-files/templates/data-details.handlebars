    <h1>Exploring themes in Gov. Brown's State of the State</h1>

    <div id="content-article-text">
        <p>Gov. Jerry Brown delivered his third State of the State address on Thursday. The speech came just months after voters approved his much-touted Proposition 30, which raised sales and income taxes temporarily.</p>
        <p>Click through KPCC's interactive word cloud to see which key words and themes Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown stressed in his third annual State of the State address.</p>
        <p>We used a website called <a href="http://tagcrowd.com/">TagCrowd</a> and the text of the speech to visualize the main topics Brown raised. The size of the word indicates the frequency with which the word appeared in the speech.</p>
        <p>We also attempted to provide some context to this list of words from Brown's speech. Clicking a word will take you to the passages in Brown's speech -- and where applicable -- links to KPCC coverage or resources about the topic.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the bulk of Brown's speech dealt with with reform of K-12 education funding, the need for the higher education systems to hold down costs, promotion of high-speed rail and water tunnels under the San Joaquin Delta.</p>
