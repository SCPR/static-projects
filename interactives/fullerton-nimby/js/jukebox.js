              "6": "But what happens when the solution includes housing the homeless in your neighborhood?",
              "11": "KPCC’s Jill Replogle tells the story of one proposed housing complex for homeless people and neighbors’ efforts to block it.",
              "19":  "This is it right here. This is the site, yeah, this is the one.",
              "22":  "I'm standing in the middle of a long, triangle-shaped lot in west Fullerton with David Gillanders.",
              "28":  "He heads an organization called Pathways of Hope, which has been providing food and shelter to homeless people in Fullerton for more than 40 years.",
              "36":  "Right now it's a city yard, so there's some railroad tracks, there's all kinds of construction materials, trucks...",
              "43":  "David has a vision for this lot: An apartment complex with Spanish Mediterranean-style architecture, to house around 60 of the city's chronically homeless. ",
              "51":  "That whole end of the property is going to be green space... It's going to look great to the people in those houses when they look across and see that as opposed to what they're saying now, which is gravel and orange cones.",
              "61":  "David went over every available space owned by the city to arrive at this location.",
              "66":  "Future residents would get their own apartment. They’d also get mental health counseling and whatever other social services they need. It’s not a shelter.",
              "74":  "It's called permanent, supportive housing. A lot of evidence shows it's the best way to get and keep people off the streets.",
              "81": "It's a solution. It's a solution to a problem everyone has been asking about for a long time.",
              "85": "Everyone wants a solution to homelessness, especially in this part of Fullerton. Neighbors here frequently complain of people sleeping in parks and defecating on their front lawns.",
              "94": "But some neighbors don't see David's proposal as a solution at all.",
              "98": "Fullerton's known for its scenic trails.",
              "100": "This is Nina Parker. I'm talking with her and her neighbor Stephanie Bromley on the patio of a busy restaurant in downtown Fullerton.",
              "109": "Now you see tents. Now you see garbage.",
              "112": "The two live a few blocks from where the Pathways apartments would be built. Nina and Stephanie are leading the opposition. Their arguments might sound familiar.",
              "123": "I'm concerned that we're just going to attract people from other cities and then they're going to become our responsibility.",
              "129": "These facilities should be in industrial areas because they are not located close to parks or close to schools.",
              "135": "We spent a lot of money to buy homes and to get our kids to school. And, you know, just to live the American dream, and we feel like our safety and our well-being is being compromised and no one's thinking about us.",
              "151": "Stephanie and Nina say they feel compassion for the homeless. Stephanie tells me she hands out McDonald's gift cards to homeless people she encounters around town.",
              "160": "But they're concerned about their kids’ safety and maintaining the quality of their good, middle-class lives. They're not the only ones. Several dozen people showed up to a city council meeting in June to rail against David's project.",
              "172": "I don't want 80 people that need security and mental health services living this close to my neighborhood.",
              "178": "We have enough going on with the homeless that are leaving their needles, their drugs, their messes.",
              "184": "We are not going to stand by and let you ruin our neighborhood more, and let this come in. We will sue you if something does not happen... (applause)",
              "193": "Some people spoke in support of the project, too. But they definitely weren't as loud, or as angry.",
              "198": "Fullerton - like cities throughout Orange County - is under pressure to house homeless people. The county has an ambitious new goal: Every city builds its fair share of 2,700 units of permanent, supportive housing. ",
              "211": "David's project is the plan’s first big test. So lots of people are watching.",
              "216": "I started reporting this story in June. That’s when Fullerton City Council told David to try and win over the neighbors. The council had planned to vote this month - any day now actually.",
              "226": "The first step as pretty innocuous: A 'yes' or 'no' on moving forward with an exclusive negotiating agreement.",
              "232": "But even that feels beyond reach for David right now. So he is pulling Pathways' request to move forward. He might try again in 2019.",
              "241": "We didn't get into this with any kind of idea that this was going to be easy or that everything was just going to roll smooth. We'll be fine, I'll be fine, but this isn't about us. This is about the people we're trying to help, and it's not fine for them.",
              "251": "California is home to more than 30,000 people who are chronically unsheltered. If no one wants to house them in their neighborhood, how will we ever get people off the streets?",
              "263": "Covering Orange County, I'm Jill Replogle."

              "8": "We're visiting projects similar to one proposed in Fullerton by an organization called Pathways of Hope. Some of the neighbors leading opposition to the project are here. So is Councilman Jesus Silva. He's leading the tour.",
              "19": "You guys want some coffee, we have coffee in the lobby here...",
              "22": "First stop: the Rockwood Apartments in Anaheim. It's an attractive, 70-unit apartment building right next to an elementary school.",
              "29": "Most of the units are for formerly homeless families. Others are for individuals. Many of the residents have mental illness and substance abuse disorders. They get onsite support for those problems.",
              "39": "All the kids, families bring chairs out, blankets out, we pass out popcorn and do movie nights out here.",
              "43": "Danielle Ball shows us around. She works for Jamboree Housing, which built Rockwood.",
              "48": "Several of the Fullerton neighbors note how nice the place looks. But they have lots of questions about the tenants and how the apartments are managed. Top of the list: drug and alcohol use.",
              "57": "Um, are there any restrictions on alcohol or drug use here?",
              "61": "No. If we see it in the community and it's causing a problem and a lease violation, then yes, they would get written up. We don't go in and do checks for alcohol...",
              "71": "This doesn't go over well with Christina Brittain.",
              "73": "Ultimately what I'm hearing from this is that our tax dollars, ultimately, are going towards supporting this, I understand that part. And that if they're doing drugs in their own little thing, that's their business, we don't see it. If you know about it, you try to help them, but don't force them to get help.",
              "88": "So they continue to stay there and it's permanent housing so they could live there for the rest of their life and use drugs in the privacy of their own home. That's crazy. I've never seen anyone use...",
              "98": "Danielle from Jamboree tries to explain that Rockwood, in this sense, is just like any other apartment building: You can't just barge into someone's unit. And you can't kick someone out for suspected drug use.",
              "108": "Plus, the idea behind this type of supportive housing is to get people off the streets first and then help them address their addiction or other problems. It's the model embraced by the federal government.",
              "118": "We head to our next site: The Doria in Irvine. It's a brand-new, 134-unit complex for low-income residents and formerly homeless people with mental illness.",
              "129": "It looks like any other new, resort-style apartment complex in Irvine. Stylish architecture; manicured grounds. It's got a pool.",
              "136": "But here, things get even messier on the tour. Some of the neighbors had been live-streaming on Facebook. And the Doria's management won't let them record. Won't let me, either. So I walk out with the Facebook Livers, including a woman named Shari Carter.",
              "148": "So I'm going to waste my time having everything sugar-coated by these people?",
              "153": "Shari lives a few blocks from the site where Pathways wants to build 60 units of permanent supportive housing in Fullerton.",
              "158": "I'm so hurt and devastated over what's happening to our community. My husband worked hard for that house. And we just want to feel safe, and they want to take that away from us?",
              "171": "Shari is convinced that the Pathways project would ruin her dreams for a peaceful retirement. She does not seem open to being persuaded otherwise. She and her husband get into their truck and leave the tour.",
              "183": "Our final stop is at The Orchard in Santa Ana. It's a 71-unit former motel that's been converted into housing for former, chronically homeless individuals and couples.",
              "192": "All of our units have full kitchens...",
              "194": "It has stylish, eco-friendly landscaping and a huge community food garden out back. The tour leaders address the standard concerns, like security.",
              "202": "And we have security gates and security guards...",
              "204": "The Pathways project would also have security. But by this point it's become clear that some of the neighbors don't care about assurances. They just want Pathways to house homeless people somewhere else. ",
              "215": "And It's not that I don't want to help the homeless. I don't want it where it's proposed.",
              "220": "To be fair, some of the neighbors later said they learned a lot from the tour, and that they now appreciate the concept of permanent supportive housing.",
              "226": "Still, I leave with a few big questions: Is this opposition an accurate reflection of how the Fullerton neighbors feel? Or just the loudest ones? And, who do local leaders listen to anyway?",

          "7": "Curtis is giving me a tour of the train and bus depot in downtown Fullerton. He slept on a bench here for eight years after he lost his job as a bus driver.",
          "15": "Then he won a legal settlement with the city in 2016 over Fullerton's failure to zone for a potential homeless shelter. He used his share of the cash settlement to get an apartment.",
          "23": "One other thing, I don't want to forget to show you the most important thing.",

          "85": "Please, I can't breathe! Put your hands behind your back! Help! Help!",
          "90": "Officers charged in Kelly's death were found not guilty. There were big protests. The police chief resigned. Three city council members were recalled. And Kelly's parents won multi-million dollar settlements.",
          "102": "What the whole, terrible incident – and the fall out – didn't do is anything to reduce the number of people like Kelly, who was schizophrenic, living on the streets. ",
          "110": "You eating tonight Robert? Alright...",
          "113": "A few blocks away, volunteers serve up spaghetti at First Christian Church for anyone who needs a meal. Jacquie Nolan greets people as they walk into the church cafeteria.",
          "122": "How many people do you usually feed here?",
          "124": "Between 100 and 120. And every night of the week there's a meal somewhere in Fullerton.",
          "126": "You guys want some dinner? You guys want some dinner?",
          "133": "Curtis keeps track of the time, day and location of all the free meals in Orange County in a one-page, homeless resource guide. He also notes places you can take a shower and get help finding housing. He carries copies of the guide with him to hand out.",
          "146": "What Curtis does – it’s part of the triage going on all over Southern California, a region facing a big crisis in homelessness. But no one thinks it’s the solution.",
          "156": "After dinner, I talk to Jason Nielsen. His plummet into homelessness started when his stressful, graveyard-shift job, and loud roommates got to be too much.",
          "165": "He went off all his mental health medications, thinking that would help calm his anxiety.",
          "169": "When you're under a lot of distress, and stress, you do things you normally wouldn't do.",
          "175": "He filtered in and out of shelters, crashed with a relative, slept in his car. This went on for several years.",
          "181": "Just weeks ago, Jason moved into his own apartment in a permanent supportive housing complex. It's in an industrial part of Fullerton.",
          "189": "That complex was originally supposed to be built in the same neighborhood that is fighting off a similar proposal now. And, yes, they fought the earlier proposal too.",
          "197": "Because of delays, the apartments Jason lives in now took five years to build and cost a million dollars more than planned. A lot of that's public funds, by the way. ",
          "207": "Jason is the type of person permanent supportive housing is intended to help -- homeless for more than a year, struggling with mental illness.",
          "214": "Does it feel good to have a place?",
          "216": "Yes, yes it does. It gives you a starting point where you can rebuild your life.",

          "225": "Fullerton has actually done more than many Southern California cities to address homelessness. And still, a recent count found 230 people sleeping outside in the city. Experts say there's just not enough land to build supportive housing only in urban areas where no one else lives.",
          "242": "Neighborhoods may have to step up, or they'll continue to have neighbors who sleep in their parks.",

          "17": "City leaders tasked David with trying to warm the neighbors to the project after some vowed to fight it tooth and nail. And I wondered, how do you do that?",
          "26": "David decided a basic education on homelessness might be a good first step.",
          "30": "And so what we wanted to do was have Becks Heyhoe from Orange County United Way do her Homelessness 101 curriculum as we advertised on the flyer...",
          "37": "Becks from United Way takes the microphone and queues up her slides on the projector. Who are Orange County's homeless? Why are they homeless? How much does homelessness cost taxpayers?",
          "46": "Research shows it's far less expensive to house people than to leave them on the streets.",
          "51": "For the most part, people listen politely. But about 20 people leave before it's over, some of them in a huff. I catch up with one woman in the hallway. She won't give me her name because she's worried about homeless people coming after her.",
          "63": "And they'll try and figure out where we live, they'll be camping on our lawns, they'll break bottles in our street, they'll leave needles strewn around...",
          "70": "She took issue with a survey Becks presented, which suggested that the lack of affordable housing is a major cause of homelessness in OC.",
          "77": "You're homeless because you made bad choices and you ended up there. So we're going to go to the city council meeting to protest it.",
          "85": "Protest David's supportive housing proposal, she means.",
          "87": "One day, after the first two community meetings about the project, I sit down for a long chat with David, on the porch of a shelter run by Pathways near downtown Fullerton. It's lovely, by the way, and seems to coexist peaceably with the neighborhood.",
          "100": "I ask him, how do you even start to penetrate a position like that woman's at the meeting? ",
          "104": "I think there's still a lot of misunderstanding. A lot of our homeless folks on the street will never work again. They will not be able to bootstrap themselves through homelessness.",
          "114": "To be considered chronically homeless — federal government's definition — you have to have been on the street for more than a year AND have a disabling condition, which includes addiction. Supportive housing, like what David is proposing, is considered the gold standard in getting such people off the streets. ",
          "128": "So David's pitch is look, we're offering to take 60 people off of Fullerton's streets for good — And keep in mind, there are some 2,700 in the county who need this kind of housing.",
          "139": "Some of the neighbors say they really care about the homeless. Some volunteer in soup kitchens and give out toys at Christmastime. And they still oppose David's housing proposal.",
          "147": "Yes, handing out toys to families matters. Yes, everyone's got to eat. But while you're helping, you know, maybe pacify or improve someone's day or get their stomachs full, that is not the same as ending homelessness. It's just not.",
          "163": "David knows he's not going to win everybody over. He even accepts that some people have zero sympathy for the homeless.",
          "170": "But for a guy who has deep, deep sympathy for them, who spends much of his life trying to help people get and stay housed, it must hurt to have to try and convince people not to block you.",
          "180": "I'm not gonna tell you it's not exhausting, but it's also exciting. I mean, it is to me in my mind, a moral issue of a country that's the richest that's ever existed, living in a county that is so wealthy, that can't figure out a way to provide for 2,700 people who are really, really vulnerable, right, and die on the streets every year.",
          "200": "You add all those things up, it's hard to say that this isn't the right thing to do. But maybe you don't want it in your neighborhood. Okay, well, we can talk about that piece of it, right?",
          "207": "I'm not sure why David is so sanguine on this last point because he also says that the lot where he wants to build 60 apartments for homeless individuals is the only available option in Fullerton. Pathways has a modest budget. It needs the city to donate the land.",
          "222": "It takes leadership and we have got to get to a place where this is less about trying to make everyone happy and more about problem solving.",
          "231": "It’s city leaders who will ultimately decide his project’s fate. And they warned him it was dead in the water if he couldn’t get neighbors' support.",
          "239": "So for now, just days before a vote was expected, David put the project on hold. Too much opposition. Too close to the November election.",
          "248": "But he’s not giving up. Maybe next year the west Fullerton neighbors will decide it's time to house the homeless.",

Because a couple of them complained to me that they take them out of the house and, you know, they inspect their house, make sure they're keeping their apartments clean and everything. I haven't had too much trouble with them, to be honest with you.",
          "101": "Residents do get their apartments inspected. It's a requirement since the complex receives federal funding. And a city spokesman confirmed that police do get called out here more than to other apartments.",
          "112": "But he says that's because the management runs a tight ship. And because the city wants to make sure there aren't any problems for the neighborhood.",
