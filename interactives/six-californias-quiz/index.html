Bachelor's degree","d":"D. Master's degree","e":"E. Professional school degree","f":"F. Doctorate degree","g":"","result":"Silicon Valley","explanation":"You are among the young and hungry who dare to dwell in the valley of the wizards. You want the best of everything, are environmentally conscious and probably take public transit to extravagant fundraisers, where your awkward schmoozing is a celebrated an art form. Comfortable zip-up hoodies and messenger bags are not a fashion statement—they’re a lifestyle. You’re on your way to the top.","datapoints":"<b>Share of California's population:</b> 17.80%</br>\n<b>Per capita personal income: </b>$63,288</br></br>\n<b>Interesting facts: </br></b>14.3 percent of people take public transportation to work and 42.5 percent have a Bachelor degree or above, both are the highest among six California states.","rowNumber":1},{"description":"","question":"What's your political leaning?","a":"A. Loyal Liberal: Very liberal on both social and fiscal issues","b":"B. Moderate Liberal: Moderately liberal on both social and fiscal issues ","c":"C. Conservative Liberal: Conservative on social issues and moderately liberal on fiscal issues","d":"D. Moderate Conservative: Moderately liberal on social issues and conservative on fiscal issues ","e":"E. Committed Conservative: Conservative on both social and fiscal issues","f":"","g":"","result":"North California","explanation":"You’re hella Cali, through and through. Outdoorsy, with a head for wine and weed. You own a rain coat and you actually use it. You’re into sports, in a chill way. And you're into your cat, in an intense way. (You’ve got the selfies to prove it.) You thrive on crazy because that's mandatory in a pool of politicians.","datapoints":"<b>Share of California's population:</b> 10%</br>\n<b>Per capita personal income: </b>$48,048</br></br>","rowNumber":2},{"description":"","question":"How do you get to work?","a":"A. Drive alone","b":"B. Carpool","c":"C. Bicycle/ train/ subway/ ferryboat","d":"D. Bus/ trolley bus","e":"E. Walk","f":"","g":"","result":"Central California","explanation":"You’re a no fuss kind of Californian and you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty. You have no problem milking a cow and you love to pick fresh fruit. But you’re also down for a weekend in the city, which is always only a car ride away. You have no problem milking a cow and you love tending to your garden or picking fresh fruit. You’d give Neel Kashkari a buck on the street but you weren’t impressed with his video, “Is California Back?” ","datapoints":"<b>Share of California's population:</b> 11%</br>\n<b>Per capita personal income: </b>$33,510</br></br>\n<b>Interesting facts: </br></b>26.7 percent of people 25-years-old and over have not completed high school and 5.7 percent work in the agriculture industry, both are the highest among six California states.","rowNumber":3},{"description":"","question":"Do you or your friends have a marijuana card?","a":"A. Yes. I personally have one.","b":"B. I don't have one, but I can always find someone with a card when I need it.","c":"C. Well... I know someone with a card, but that's not common. ","d":"D. Never heard of anyone having it. Weed is not my thing.","e":"","f":"","g":"","result":"West California","explanation":"You’re a triple threat (or are you?) and you’re not afraid to let us know about it. You either work in the industry or you definitely know someone who does. (And by industry, we mean Hollywood. Duh.) You drive EVERYWHERE and can’t help complaining about traffic. But hey, so does everyone else. You don’t follow trends. You just regurgitate them from ‘80s. Oh, and you totally eat healthy — most of the time. Does In-N-Out have vegan options?","datapoints":"<b>Share of California's population:</b> 30.20%</br>\n<b>Per capita personal income: </b>$44,900</br></br>\n<b>Interesting facts: </br></b>In the past ten years, only eight marijuana cards were issued per 10,000 people, the lowest among six California states.","rowNumber":4},{"description":"","question":"What are your sentiments toward the drought?","a":"A. What drought?","b":"B. I do my best to conserve — but you got to wash your car every now and then, right?","c":"C. I haven't showered in days.","d":"","e":"","f":"","g":"","result":"South California","explanation":"Dude, let’s go to the beach. You’d rather be in the lineup to catch a wave than anywhere else. Except maybe the bar. Shots, anyone? Let’s just say you like to have a good time. When it comes to sports, you’re used to cheering for the underdog. But you’re not about to go to a game in temps under 60 degrees because that would be way too cold. Did we mention? You eat tacos for breakfast.","datapoints":"<b>Share of California's population:</b> 28.40%</br>\n<b>Per capita personal income: </b>$42,980</br></br>","rowNumber":5},{"description":"","question":"Which industry do you WANT to work in?","a":"A.

Agriculture: Farmer, gardener, landscaper","e":"E. Finance: Banker, accountant, analyst","f":"F. Entertainment: Filmmaker, photographer, composer ","g":"G. Sommelier: Wine, wine, wine","result":"Jefferson","explanation":"You like living in the slow lane. You’re down-to-earth and prefer the inexpensive things in life. Why buy it if you can build? You’re the kind of person who embraces that flannel and worn-in jeans look (and not in a normcore kind-of-way). You love your scenery but not all the people around it.","datapoints":"<b>Share of California's population:</b> 2.50%</br>\n<b>Per capita personal income: </b>$36,147</br></br>\n<b>Interesting facts: </br></b>\nEveryday, 212 gallons of water is consumed for domestic use per capita, which is the highest among six California states.\nIn the past ten years, 74 marijuana cards were issued per 10,000 people, also the highest among six California states.","rowNumber":6},{"description":"","question":"Do you like cats?","a":"A.

NO way.","e":"","f":"","g":"","result":"","explanation":"","datapoints":"","rowNumber":7},{"description":"","question":"What’s your ideal wedding?","a":"A. At a vineyard with great wine and killer company. ","b":"B.  Friendship ceremony with an intimate group among the Redwoods.","c":"C. An extravagant party with a photo booth. Oh, and did we mention? It’s “Game of Thrones” themed. ","d":"D. Beach wedding. Flip flops and the sounds of the ocean.","e":"E. Something fancy. Maybe the Beverly Hills Hotel. Or how about a yacht?","f":"F. A charming barn wedding. Think rustic chic. ","g":"","result":"","explanation":"","datapoints":"","rowNumber":8}];
