            <p><strong>How did we achieve the result?</strong></p>
            <p>We've designed 9 questions in this quiz and each quiz has 3 to 6 answers. Each answer falls into one or two out of the six California states, you will get the result for whichever state you scored most.</br>Please notice that KPCC's online quizzes are not scientific surveys with rigorous statistical process, although they are largely supported by data from credible sources.</br>
            Below is an explainer of all the questions and how we decide on the answers either based on data or general stereotypes.</p>

                <li><strong>Data explanation</strong>: The map shows how places differ by opinions on social and fiscal issues.
