    <h1>Explaining the Monthly Jobs Report</h1>

    <div id="content-article-text">
        <p>On the first Friday of each month, the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> releases the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a>, commonly known as the monthly jobs report.</p>
        <p>The Employment Situation Summary details the level of "nonfarm payroll employment" over the previous month and the current unemployment rate. The BLS also details employment in various sectors and industries, such as professional and business services, health care and retail trade.</p>
        <p>Each month the BLS also revises nonfarm payroll employment from the two prior months. The result is an "Initial" figure, a "Revised" figure and a "Final" figure. The chart and table below attempt to illustrate the differences between the "Initial" figure and the "Final" figure.</p>
        <p>For example: In April the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_05042012.htm">BLS intially reported</a> that the economy added 115,000 new jobs that month. The bureau decreased the figure to 77,000 new jobs in its <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_06012012.htm">June 2012 release</a> and finalized the figure at 68,000 new jobs in its <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_07062012.htm">July 2012 release</a>. The difference between the "Initial" estimate and the "Final" estimate was -47,000 jobs added.</p>
