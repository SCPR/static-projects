            <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District gets $6.8 billion to educate its 650,000 students, plus another $5.2 billion to build and maintain schools, provide adult education and service debts.</p>
            <p>This data set shows how administrators plan to spend the $4.6 billion headed directly to schools next year. But their choices are few: the biggest chunk of money will be doled out to teacher salaries and pension obligations, which put many schools in the red.</p>
            <p>Whatâ€™s left will head to central management and district-wide initiatives.</p>
