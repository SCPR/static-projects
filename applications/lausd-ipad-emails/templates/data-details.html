            <p>Emails obtained by KPCC through a public records request show Los Angeles Unified School District John Deasy directed his staff to figure out how to incorporate Pearson PLC's software into the school system's plan to transition to the Common Core standards.</p>
            <p>Officials with Pearson &ndash; the largest publishing company in the world &ndash; were copied on communication between Deasy and Jaime Aquino, the district's head of curriculum at the time, who <a href="http://projects.scpr.org/applications/lausd-ipad-emails/dc.html?doc=1281195-2012-05-24-email-thread-between-john-deasy-and" target="blank">expressed reservations at some of the costs</a> and the speed with which the district was moving. Emails show Pearson weighed in on questions of how to finance software purchases.</p>
            <p>Deasy also <a href="http://projects.scpr.org/applications/lausd-ipad-emails/dc.html?doc=1281190-2012-07-2-from-john-deasy.html" target="blank">personally pitched Apple on working with Pearson</a>, according to the emails.</p>
            <p>Those meetings and conversations began nearly a year before L.A. Unified put the project out to public bid. Apple and Pearson won the contract on June 24, 2013, after committees made up of school district staff members picked them from among 19 bids.</p>
