It became my favorite place to go and sit almost immediately after I began there in 2007. There's a particular path lined with benches just north of Sacred Heart Chapel, and that was always my go-to spot. It overlooks Playa Vista and much of West L.A. - and is just so quiet. I've sat there for literally hours, getting lost in thought, or thinking about nothing at all, or sitting and talking with friends. I think part of the reason it's my favorite place is because I associate it with LMU and my college years and all the wonderful people I met there -\u00a0it's very familiar, which can be comforting a few years out of college. Over the years, the emotions I've felt there have run the gamut: sadness, joy, nostalgia, frustration, being completely overwhelmed, being completely content.                It's also a great place to smoke a cigar.

It is shared and yet deeply personal.  It is public and private all in one.  The soothing smell of words on paper just does something to people.
