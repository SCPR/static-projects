            <p>Bus shelters protect transit users from the elements, from the summer sun to winter rains. Since the 1980’s the city of L.A. has paid for shelters by contracting with a company that sells advertising on them.</p>
            <p>Under a 2001 contract, the company CBS/Decaux agreed to install more than 1,000 bus shelters in the city of L.A. over two decades, in exchange for a share of the advertising revenue. But the agreement has unraveled and after nearly 15 years, the majority of those shelters still haven’t gone up.</p>
            <p>The city has issued permits for shelters at 1,450 locations but only 621 have been installed. Some areas have gotten a greater portion of their intended shelters. Below, areas of Los Angeles are split up by zip code. Darker areas have seen a higher share of their shelters installed. Click on an area to see details.</p>
