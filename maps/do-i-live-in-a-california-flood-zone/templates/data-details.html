            <p>A strong El Ni√±o climate pattern <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/12/10/56140/el-nino-update-still-on-track-for-a-stormy-socal-w/">is on its way to Southern California</a>, and might bring with it some much-needed rain. But that precipitation could be a double-edged sword, raising the possibility of flooding in a region struggling with drought.</p>
            <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) tracks areas vulnerable to a 100-year flood, or a flood that has <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/pdf/100-year-flood-handout-042610.pdf">a one percent chance of occurring in any given year</a>. FEMA requires homeowners to purchase flood insurance in those flood zones. The agency's data shows that populated areas around the state are at risk. A much broader swath of the state is vulnerable in a 500-year flood, but insurance isn't required in those areas. For more about flood mapping and insurance, and for an official determination on if you are in a flood zone, consult <a href="http://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program">FEMA</a>.</p>
