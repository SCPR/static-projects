# Making a GIF from the US Forest Service's smoke projections
The United States Forest Service projects the future path of smoke â€“ which can be important information during fire season. The agency's model, known as the BlueSky Modeling Framework, incorporates information about fires, fuel loadings, consumption, emissions, plume height and smoke trajectory.

While only projections ([read more about the project here](http://viewer.smoke.airfire.org/run/standard/CANSAC-2km/2016062400/)), the 'runs' are a neat visual tool and are regularly updated.

During the June, 2016 San Gabriel Complex Fire, [we created a GIF of the projections](https://projects.scpr.org/maps/2016-san-gabriel-complex-fire-smoke/), to show the path of the smoke.

Creating one of these is pretty simple to do on a Mac. 

# 10 steps
1. First, go to the BlueSky page at this URL: [http://viewer.smoke.airfire.org/websky/v1/](http://viewer.smoke.airfire.org/websky/v1/)

2. Choose the CA/NV 'domain' and the latest run. 

3. Zoom in on the general area of the fire and where the smoke disperses for the best visual.

4. I'd advise slowing down the playback by one notch, which can be done with the gray minus button above the map.

5. Now stop the map at the first frame, or wherever you want to begin.

6. To take a video screenshot, open Quicktime and go File > New Screen Recording. Hit the record button and then select the portion of the scren you want to record. This will be the map, with the top and bottom cropped out.

7. Hit play in the browser. Let it run and stop the screen recording when done.

8. Convert the video to a GIF [using this tool](http://ezgif.com/video-to-gif). You can edit the start and end points at that site. I recommend a lower FPS for a smaller file. You can also resize the GIF, to make smaller for social, [elsewhere on that site](http://ezgif.com/resize). 

9. Post the gif online, through our projects page or a service such as giphy.

10. Make a note of the time in text next to where you embed the GIF.
