            <p>Since 2008, local water agencies have been trying to get homeowners to rip out their lawns by offering cash incentives for grass removal. According to KPCC estimates and an analysis of state property records, there is roughly 5.5 billion square feet of irrigated residential yards in the cities that get water from the Metropolitan Water District, Southern California’s main water wholesaler. Outdoor watering accounts for more than half of residential water use.</p>
            <p>After some pilot and local programs, Metropolitan began offering $1 for each square foot of ditched grass through a region wide "SoCal WaterSmart" program beginning in 2011; this year, when Metropolitan’s board doubled its overall conservation budget, it raised the incentive to $2. Some cities offer additional amounts: Anaheim and Los Angeles pay an extra $1, and Long Beach chips in an extra $1.50.</p>
            <p>Interest in the program is growing, but adoption has so far been small. Records compiled from the Metropolitan Water District, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Burbank Water and Power, the City of Anaheim, the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, the Western Municipal Water District and other sources reveal that nearly 5 million square feet of lawn have been torn out because of incentive programs&mdash;that’s less than one-tenth of one percent of the square footage possible.</p>
