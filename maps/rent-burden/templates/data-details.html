            <p>For years, financial planners used a 30 percent threshold as a rule of thumb for renters: no more than 30 percent of your gross income should go to rent. But for many these days, the 30 percent rule is a distant fantasy. More than half of the renters in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties are above that 30 percent threshold, according to the latest estimates available from the U.S. Census Bureau. Using the map below, explore how much people are paying for rent in different neighborhoods. The numbers are based on the median gross rent as a percent of income — that means half the renters pay above, and half below, the amount shown.</p>

            <p><strong>Source</strong>: U.S. Census Bureau.</a> Renter data based on American Community Survey 2015 5-year estimates. The reliability of individual estimates is based on the coefficient of variance (CV). Any zip code in which either the estimated number of renters or the median rent burden has a CV above 10 percent is not displayed. Any other estimates with a CV above 10 percent has been noted as potentially unreliable directly in the map. Number of renters is based on occupied housing units from ACS Table B25003. Median monthly rent is based on renter-occupied housing units paying cash rent from ACS Table B25064. Median annual income is based on occupied housing units from the past 12 months and displayed in 2015 inflation-adjusted dollars from ACS Table B25119. Median rent burden is based on renter-occupied housing units paying cash rent from the past 12 months from ACS Table B25071. Household rent burden as a percentage of its income is based on renter-occupied housing units from the past 12 months from ACS Table B25070.</p>
