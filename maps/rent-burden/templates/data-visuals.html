                <p><strong>Source</strong>: U.S. Census Bureau.</a></p><p><strong>About the data:</strong> This map is based on an <a href="https://projects.scpr.org/longreads/high-rent-few-options/">earlier project</a> by <a href="http://www.scpr.org/about/people/staff/ben-bergman">Ben Bergman</a> and <a href="http://www.scpr.org/about/people/staff/chris-keller">Chris Keller</a>. Renter data is based on American Community Survey 2015 5-year estimates. The reliability of individual estimates is based on the coefficient of variance (CV). Any zip code in which either the estimated number of renters or the median rent burden has a CV above 30 percent is not displayed. Any other estimates with a CV above 30 percent have been noted as potentially unreliable. Number of renters is based on occupied housing units from ACS Table B25003. Median monthly rent is based on renter-occupied housing units paying cash rent from ACS Table B25064. Median annual income is based on occupied housing units from the past 12 months and displayed in 2015 inflation-adjusted dollars from ACS Table B25119. Median rent burden is based on renter-occupied housing units paying cash rent from the past 12 months from ACS Table B25071. Household rent burden as a percentage of its income is based on renter-occupied housing units from the past 12 months from ACS Table B25070.</p>
