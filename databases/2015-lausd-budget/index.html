                <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District's $8 billion budget pays for more than 25,000 teachers and serves 650,000 students.</p>
 
  <p>Superintendent Ramon Cortines and the school board are designating a $820 million increase in funding covering the 2015-2016 school year largely for teacher raises, maintenance, instructional materials, and other overdue operational costs deferred during the recession.</p>
   
  <p>As part of Gov. Jerry Brown’s formula for local education, L.A. Unified received more than $1 billion to serve low-income students, foster youth and English learners. Advocates contend little is being invested in new and improved services for these students while the new cash flows to general operations.</p>
   
  <p>This data shows the priorities of Cortines and the board for the next school year.  Each line represents a major spending group – such as preschool, teacher costs and cafeteria funds – alongside its percent change from last school year.</p>
