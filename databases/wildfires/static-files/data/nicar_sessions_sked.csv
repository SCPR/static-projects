Sports are the original form of data journalism -- box scores predate open government movements by about a century. And Joseph Adler's ""Baseball Hacks"" trained newbie Web CAR reporters how to scrape and analyze data sets using Perl and MySQL. Finally, sports analytics are a leading indicator for other kinds of analysis. Sensors, economic analysis, leverage are all de rigeur in baseball but still up-and-coming in data journalism. We'll take the concepts being used to analyze baseball, football, soccer and apply them to standard data journalism chores. A good example of this is leverage -- in baseball, an analyst attempts to find those situations in which a player had the greatest opportunity to change the outcome of a game. In data journalism, we might use a similar tool to analyze critical paths to an election win for a candidate or put together a network graph for bundled contributions to PACs."
