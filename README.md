### Fresh Prince Lyrics

Now this is the story all about how 

My life got flipped, turned upside down 

And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there 

I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air 


In west Philadelphia born and raised 

On the playground where I spent most of my days 

Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool 

And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school 

When a couple of guys, they were up to no good 

Started making trouble in my neighbourhood 

I got in one little fight and my mom got scared 

And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air" 


I whistled for a cab and when it came near the 

License plate said "fresh" and had a dice in the mirror 

If anything I could say that this cab was rare 

But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air! 


I pulled up to a house about seven or eight 

And I yelled to the cabby "Yo, homes smell you later!" 

Looked at my kingdom I was finally there 

To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air
